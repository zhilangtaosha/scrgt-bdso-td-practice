       "  'plot': \"Lance Clayton (Robin Williams)  is a single father and high school English teacher whose biggest fear is that he will one day end up all alone. He dreams of becoming a famous writer, but his previous novels have all been rejected by publishers. His 15-year-old son Kyle (Daryl Sabara) is a pornography-obsessed underachiever who despises and is annoyed by everyone, especially his father. Kyle is a student at the school where Lance teaches an unpopular poetry class. His only friend is Andrew, a fellow student who spends his evenings at the Claytons' house trying to avoid his alcoholic mother. Kyle's consistently poor academic performance and vile behavior gain the attention of the school principal (Geoff Pierson), who advises Lance that Kyle should transfer to a special-needs school. Lance is in a non-committal relationship with a younger teacher named Claire (Alexie Gilmore), who is spending time with a fellow teacher named Mike (Henry Simmons), whose writing class is more successful than Lance's. On nights when Claire cancels their dates and he is alone, Lance bonds with his elderly neighbor Bonnie (Mitzi McCall).\\nOne night, after Kyle and Lance spend an evening with Claire, Lance discovers that Kyle has died in an autoerotic asphyxiation accident in his bedroom. To avoid embarrassing his son, he stages Kyle's death as a suicide. He writes a suicide note on Kyle's computer and hangs his son's body in the closet. A classmate later obtains the suicide note from police records and publishes it in the school newspaper. The note strikes a chord with the students and faculty, and suddenly many students claim to have been friends with Kyle and are touched by how deep and intelligent he shows himself to be in his writings.\\nEnjoying the attention his writing is finally receiving, Lance decides to write and publish a phony journal that was supposedly written by his son before his death. Kyle becomes something of a postmortem cult phenomenon at the school, and soon Lance begins to receive the adoration that he has always desired. Andrew finds Kyle's suicide note and journals as highly uncharacteristic based on Kyle's personality when he was alive, but Lance brushes him off when Andrew confronts him. The journal soon attracts the attention of book publishers and Lance lands a television appearance on a nationally broadcast talk show. The school principal then decides to rename the school library in Kyle's honor.\\nAt the library dedication, Lance starts to feel guilty for exploiting his son's death for his own benefit as well as hatred towards those who pretend to like Kyle when in reality they didn't. While giving a speech, Lance decides he can no longer continue the charade and confesses to everyone that Kyle's death was accidental, and that he wrote the suicide note and journal. Predictably, Lance is denounced by the students and faculty, including Claire; and at the same time finally realizes that it is better to be alone than to end up with people who make you feel all alone. Despite now being despised by everyone, Lance nevertheless feels reborn and dives naked into the school's swimming pool. Outside, Andrew tells Lance that he knew the truth all along, and that he enjoyed Lance's writing and encourages him to keep writing which Lance says he will. The film ends as the two happily watch a zombie movie with Bonnie.\",\n",

       "  'plot': '13-year-old Conor O\\'Malley holds a close bond to his seriously ill mother, and maintains the household during her regular chemotherapy treatments at the hospital. Conor\\'s grandmother often visits, and she suggests that Conor live with her in the event of his mother\\'s death. Conor is reluctant to take up this offer due to her cold personality. At school, Conor is ridiculed as a daydreamer and is regularly tormented by his classmate Harry. Conor is also plagued by a nightmare in which the old church near his house collapses and falls into a hole, where someone else is in danger of plummeting and he tries to hold onto them. Conor vents his emotions via drawing, a talent he inherited from his mother. One night, exactly seven minutes past midnight, he awakes from his nightmare to see the large yew tree next to the church transform into a gnarled monster that approaches Conor\\'s home and speaks to him. The Monster says that it will tell Conor three stories during their next meetings, after which Conor must tell the Monster a fourth tale in return.\\nIn the Monster\\'s first story, a prince escapes from his stepmother, the supposedly-evil queen, with his bride, but then kills his sleeping bride under a yew tree and makes the queen into a scapegoat so that his people can drive the queen away and make him king. As the condition of Conor\\'s mother worsens, Conor moves in with his grandmother. Conor\\'s father, who lives in Los Angeles with a new family, visits Conor and invites him to visit his stepfamily on Christmas, which gives Conor hope that he might live with him permanently. After Conor angrily damages his grandmother\\'s valuable watch, the Monster appears and tells his second story: a hard-hearted parson forbids an apothecary from extracting medicine from an old yew tree, only to rescind this measure when his own children become ill. However, the apothecary cannot help him, and the Monster begins to destroy the parson\\'s house as punishment. Conor enthusiastically joins in on the destruction, but comes to find that he has decimated his grandmother\\'s living room. His grandmother, while bitter, does not punish Conor.\\nConor\\'s mother\\'s condition declines further, and her doctors turn to a final treatment involving yew wood. Conor learns of this and implores the Monster to heal his mother, only for the Monster to dismiss the matter as outside of his responsibility. At school, Harry proclaims to Conor that he will no longer bother Conor because he \"no longer sees [him]\". The Monster appears and tells a story of an invisible man who did not want to be so. With the Monster\\'s support, Conor attacks Harry and hospitalizes him. To Conor\\'s astonishment, the headmistress refrains from punishing Conor as she comprehends Conor\\'s current situation. When it becomes clear that his mother will die, Conor runs to the yew tree, where the Monster forces him to relive his nightmare, in which his mother dangles for her life. Conor finally admits that he had long suspected that his mother would not survive her illness and secretly hoped that she would die soon, which fills him with guilt. The Monster tells him that he did not truly want his mother to die, but simply to end his own suffering. Conor\\'s grandmother finds him asleep under the yew tree and drives him to the hospital, during which Conor reconciles with her. At the hospital, Conor embraces his mother one last time before she dies seven minutes past noon. Conor returns to his grandmothers house, where his mother\\'s old room is refurbished for him. In the room, he finds his mother\\'s old art book, which depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing of his mother as a child with the Monster.',\n",

       "  'summary': \"The beaver (genus Castor) is a large, primarily nocturnal, semiaquatic rodent. Castor includes two extant species, the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) (native to North America) and Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) (Eurasia). Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6–12 million. This population decline is the result of extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because the beavers' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.\"},\n",

The film underwent development in the mid-2000s, with production lasting nearly a decade. Produced and distributed by In The Light Productions, the first version of the film premiered on 18 October 2014 at the Hollywood Film Festival, with a film festival run throughout 2014 and 2015 and a theatrical run with the final version of the film in 2016. It has had nearly 300 theatrical and community screenings in 140 cities in 16 countries, earned 27 awards, and was covered in 28 publications.The film has been used to help advance local environmental organizations\\' mission as well as grow the nature-connecting movement. The film team partnered with film screenings\\' hosts to create \"view and do\" events, offering audience members the opportunity to engage in a nature program following the screening of the film. Rokab expanded this concept by creating Love Thy Nature Journeys with expeditions and workshops which start with the screening of the film and then transitions into activities guiding attendees in the wilderness for nature communion and forest therapy.'}]"
