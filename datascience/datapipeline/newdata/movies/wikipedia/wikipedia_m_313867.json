Published in 1990, it was the last of Dahl's books to be published in his lifetime. Unlike other Dahl works (which often feature tyrannical adults and heroic/magical children), Esio Trot is the story of an old, lonely man (Mr Hoppy), trying to make a connection with a person that he has loved from afar (a widow named Mrs Silver).In 1994, Monty Python member Michael Palin provided the English language audiobook recording of the book. In 2015 it was adapted by Richard Curtis into a BBC television film, Roald Dahl's Esio Trot, featuring Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench as the couple, with James Corden narrating."}
