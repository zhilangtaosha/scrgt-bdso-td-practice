The film is based on the 2006 graphic novel of the same name created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. The plot revolves around an amnesiac outlaw (Craig), a wealthy cattleman (Ford), and a mysterious traveler (Wilde) who must ally to save a group of townspeople abducted by aliens. The screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, based on a screen story by the latter two along with Steve Oedekerk. The film was produced by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Kurtzman, Orci and Rosenberg, with Steven Spielberg and Favreau serving as executive producers.\nThe project began development in April 1997, when Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures bought film rights to a concept pitched by Rosenberg, former president at Malibu Comics, which he described as a graphic novel in development. After the graphic novel was published in 2006, development on the film was begun again, and Favreau signed on as director in September 2009. On a budget of $163 million, filming for Cowboys & Aliens began in June 2010, in New Mexico and California. Despite studio pressure to release the film in 3-D, Favreau chose to film traditionally and in anamorphic format (widescreen picture on standard 35 mm film) to further a \"classic movie feel\". Measures were taken to maintain a serious Western element despite the film's \"inherently comic\" title and premise. The film's aliens were designed to be \"cool and captivating\", with some details, such as a fungus that grows on their wounds, created to depict the creatures as frontiersmen facing adversity in an unfamiliar place.\nCowboys & Aliens premiered at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on July 29, 2011. The film was considered to be a financial disappointment, taking $174.8 million in box office receipts on a $163 million budget. Cowboys & Aliens received mixed reviews, with critics generally praising its acting while criticizing other aspects.", "plot": "In 1873 New Mexico Territory, an unnamed loner (Daniel Craig) awakens injured in the desert with no memory and with a strange metal gauntlet attached to his left wrist. He wanders into the town of Absolution, where preacher Meacham (Clancy Brown) treats his wound. Sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine) recognizes the stranger as wanted outlaw Jake Lonergan and attempts to arrest him. Jake beats up the posse sent to take him in and nearly escapes, but a woman named Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) knocks him out. Taggart prepares to transport both Jake and petulant young drunkard Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano) to Santa Fe for trial.\nPercy's father, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), a ruthless cattle baron, demands Percy to  be released. He also demands Jake be released to him, since Jake had stolen gold from him. During the standoff, alien spacecraft begin attacking the town. Percy, Taggart, and other townsfolk are abducted by long, whip-like feelers hanging from the bottom of the ships. Jake's bracelet inexplicably activates and becomes a weapon; he shoots down a ship, ending the attack.\nDolarhyde, Ella, and other townsfolk form a posse to track an injured alien that escaped from the downed ship. Meanwhile, Jake travels to an abandoned cabin and, in a flashback, recalls returning to it with stolen gold and then being abducted, along with a woman named Alice, by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins up with the posse. During the evening, the group comes upon a capsized paddle wheel steamboat that the aliens apparently dumped hundreds of miles from any rivers capable of holding it. They camp in it, and during the night the alien they were tracking kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.\nBy morning, most of the posse has deserted, and those remaining are attacked by Jake's former gang. Jake, who had stolen the gang's loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control but it is foiled. The aliens begin attacking them again and Ella is captured. Jake jumps aboard the ship and attacks the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash. The alien survives the crash, suddenly comes out of the water and attacks Ella, fatally wounding her. Jake then kills the alien with his wrist-blaster.\nThe remaining posse is captured by Chiricahua Apache Native Americans, who blame them for the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and emerges from the fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had travelled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens, who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments to find humans' weaknesses, are far stronger and more durable than humans, and have superior weaponry, but are not invulnerable. They can be stabbed and shot to death, but only Jake's gauntlet weapon or a well-aimed shot with a rifle can kill them with a single blast. Ella tells them that the aliens who previously attacked them are just scouts.\nShe also claims Jake holds the secret to the aliens' whereabouts and argues that they must defeat the aliens before the invaders exterminate all life on Earth. After taking medicine offered by the Apaches' medicine man, Jake recalls that Alice was euthanized after she was used in an alien experiment, but he had escaped, inadvertently stealing the gauntlet-like alien weapon encasing his wrist. He then also remembers the location of the aliens' base of operations.\nArmed with this knowledge, the group, now led by Dolarhyde, prepares to attack the aliens' grounded mother ship. Meanwhile, Jake returns to his old gang and persuades them to join the fight. After the humans maneuver the aliens into a ground battle, Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him, and both men escape from the ship after killing the alien responsible for Alice's death. As the remaining aliens are taking off in their damaged craft, Ella sacrifices herself by entering the ship's core and destroying it by using Jake's wrist gauntlet as a bomb, obliterating the ship.\nWith the aliens gone, the abducted townsfolk begin to remember their pasts. Still a wanted man, Jake decides to leave, though the sheriff and Dolarhyde say they will claim he was killed in the invasion. The citizens intend to reconstruct their town.", "cast": "The cast includes:\nDaniel Craig as Jake Lonergan, an amnesiac outlaw.\nHarrison Ford as Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde, a powerful cattleman\nOlivia Wilde as Ella Swenson, a mysterious traveler who aids Lonergan.\nSam Rockwell as Doc, owner of Absolution's local saloon (when he isn't tending to patients).\nPaul Dano as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow's trouble-making son.\nClancy Brown as Meacham, Absolution's preacher and doctor (when the real one is too busy tending bar).\nKeith Carradine as Sheriff John Taggart, Absolution's sheriff.\nNoah Ringer as Emmett Taggart, John Taggart's grandson.\nAdam Beach as Nat Colorado, Dolarhyde's Native American right-hand man.\nAbigail Spencer as Alice, Jake's lost love.\nAna de la Reguera as Mar\u00eda, Absolution's saloon maid and Doc's wife.\nWalton Goggins as Hunt, a bandit and friend of Lonergan.\nJulio Cedillo as Bronc, a Mexican bandit.\nDavid O'Hara as Pat Dolan, Lonergan's former gang-member.\nToby Huss as Roy Murphy\nRaoul Trujillo as Black Knife, the Chiricahua Apache chief.\nPaul Ortega as Apache Medicine Man"}
