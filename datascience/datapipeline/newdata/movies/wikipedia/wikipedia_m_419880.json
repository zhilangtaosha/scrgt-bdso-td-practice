His harrowing and moving account of a group of blind girl orphans being refused food in a restaurant in the city has been referenced by several other authors:\n\nThe experience changed my outlook. Until now I had clung to the comforting belief that human beings eventually come to terms with pain and sorrow. Now I understood I was wrong, and like Paul I suffered a conversion \u2013 but to pessimism. These little girls, any one of whom could be my daughter, came into the restaurant weeping, and they were weeping when they were led away. I knew that, condemned to everlasting darkness, hunger and loss, they would weep on incessantly. They would never recover from their pain, and I would never recover from the memory of it.\nNaples '44 was first published by William Collins in 1978 and republished as a paperback by Eland Books in 1983.\nAn Italian/English documentary film based upon it, Napoli '44/Naples '44, directed by Francesco Patierno and narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch, premiered at the Rome International Film Festival in October 2016."}
