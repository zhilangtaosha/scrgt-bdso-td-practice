Despite his wealth, he is disillusioned and depressed as most of his recent film work is low-brow and poorly received.

Believing he is about to die, he returns to his roots of stand-up comedy.\nIra Wright is an aspiring stand-up comedian in his 20s who shares an apartment with his two best friends, Mark and Leo. Mark is a lead in his own TV comedy series and makes good money. Leo is a rising comedy star and guest star for a recurring role on Mark's TV show. George meets Ira at a small comedy club and hires him as his assistant. Ira becomes one of George's only close relationships. The two travel around the country, George hires Ira as his personal assistant and joke writer and opens for him in the big comedy clubs, often meeting with real life comedians who play themselves and talk about the business of comedy.\nGeorge reconnects with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Laura who is currently married to Clarke. George\u2032s physician tells him that the leukemia is in remission. George decides he wants Laura back. Laura invites George and Ira to her house in Marin County while her husband is away on business. George and Ira spend quality time with Laura and her two young daughters. George and Laura sneak off to have sex, but Clarke returns home and there is an altercation.\nLaura faces a choice between her husband, Clarke, who she suspects has cheated on her (he later confirms he received a happy ending at a massage parlor), or George (who also cheated on her many times). Ira is not always on George's side in the love triangle, so when it doesn't go George's way in the end, he fires Ira, who then calls George out on having learned nothing from his near-death experience.\nIra returns to his old food-service job.
