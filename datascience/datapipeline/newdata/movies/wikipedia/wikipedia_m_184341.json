Later, Duran joins a boxing club with Nestor \"Plomo\" Qui\u00f1ones as his coach.\nAs he reaches 20, an American legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel, who nearly lost his life after being attacked by an unknown assailant in 1953 in New York City and is now living with his wife Stephanie, notices Roberto's raw talent and punching power and takes the young fighter under his wing, becoming his coach. Not long after, Dur\u00e1n then meets a student, Felicidad, with whom he later has five children.\nAfter his fights through the 70s and 80s, rising through the divisions with phenomenal success (just one loss) he challenges Sugar Ray Leonard, dubbed as the \"Fighter of the Year.\" However, Dur\u00e1n is disrespectful of Leonard, describing him as a \"clown\" and confidently predicts a knock out win for himself.\nOne night, Dur\u00e1n insults Leonard in front of his wife by calling him a \"homosexual\". The incident frustrates Ray. Dur\u00e1n's hard feelings for Ray, on the other hand seem to stem from his resentment of Americans in general, because he recalls the ill-treatment meted out by the Americans to the nation of Panama, remembering how American troops took over the country by owning the Panama Canal\u2014leading to conflict between the sides in 1964.\nIn June 1980 in Montreal, the day of fight between Dur\u00e1n and Leonard; Dur\u00e1n wins via Unanimous decision as a Welterweight Champion (148\u2013147, 145\u2013144, 146\u2013144). After the fight, Leonard states that being insulted is a strategy and calls for a rematch with an $8 million purse. At the house party, Dur\u00e1n is informed by his manager Carlos Eleta and he reluctantly agrees to the rematch. Chaflan is killed after being run over by a truck.\nIn November 1980, Dur\u00e1n and Leonard face at the ring for the second time, this time the venue is in New Orleans. But in the eighth round, Dur\u00e1n gives up by saying \"No m\u00e1s\" (English: \"No more\") to the referee, angering the entire Panama community, thus Leonard wins via technical knockout (68\u201366, 68\u201366, and 67\u201366).\nUpon returning home in Panama, he faces angry protests. Dur\u00e1n tells his wife that he regrets letting them down and needs to go back in the ring in order to regain his popularity and the forgiveness of his fans. Due to this incident, Arcel is retired from his training and tells Dur\u00e1n that Plomo will be his coach. In June 1983, New York City, the day of his fight against Davey Moore, Leonard gratefully meets Dur\u00e1n for the first time since the rematch, saying that he forgives Dur\u00e1n. He tells Leonard that he gives his apology to his wife. As the fight with Moore goes up to the eighth round, in which Leonard is the commentator, Dur\u00e1n wins the fight via technical knockout and eventually restores his popularity and pride with the people of Panama.\nIn the film's epilogue, it states that Plomo was in Dur\u00e1n's side for each fight until his death in 2012; Leonard and Dur\u00e1n remain friends until now; Ray Arcel was the first boxing trainer to be inducted into both the World Boxing Hall of Fame (WBHF) as the International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHF). He died on March 7, 1994, at the age of 94 after a six-year battle with leukemia.", "cast": "\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez as Roberto Dur\u00e1n\nRobert De Niro as Ray Arcel\nUsher as Sugar Ray Leonard Credited as \"Usher Raymond IV\".\nOscar Jaenada as Chaflan\nJurnee Smollett-Bell as Juanita Leonard\nEllen Barkin as Stephanie Arcel\nRub\u00e9n Blades as Carlos Eleta\nPedro P\u00e9rez as Plomo Qui\u00f1ones\nAna de Armas as Felicidad Iglesias\nJohn Turturro as Frankie Carbo\nEliud Kauffman as Margarito Duran\nJohn Duddy as Ken Buchanan\nJoe Urla as Angelo Dundee"}
