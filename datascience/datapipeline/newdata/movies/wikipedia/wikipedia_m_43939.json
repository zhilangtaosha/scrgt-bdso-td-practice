Throughout the filming period, Phoenix remained in character for public appearances, giving many the impression that he was genuinely pursuing a new career.", "plot": "In 2008, while rehearsing for a charity event, actor Joaquin Phoenix, with Casey Affleck's camera watching, tells people he is quitting acting to pursue a career in rap music. Over the next year, Phoenix writes, rehearses, and performs to an audience. He approaches Sean Combs in hopes he will produce the record.
