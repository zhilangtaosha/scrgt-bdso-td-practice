The discomfort often rises in the chest and may radiate to the neck, throat, or angle of the jaw.\nHeartburn is usually due to regurgitation of gastric acid (gastric reflux) into the esophagus and is the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In about 0.6% of cases it is a symptom of ischemic heart disease."}
