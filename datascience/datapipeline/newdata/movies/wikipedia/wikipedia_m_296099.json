People often take a vacation during specific holiday observances, or for specific festivals or celebrations. Vacations are often spent with friends or family.A person may take a longer break from work, such as a sabbatical, gap year, or career break.\nThe concept of taking a vacation is a recent invention, and has developed through the last two centuries. Historically, the idea of travel for recreation was a luxury that only wealthy people could afford (see Grand Tour).  In the Puritan culture of early America, taking a break from work for reasons other than weekly observance of the Sabbath was frowned upon. However, the modern concept of vacation was led by a later religious movement encouraging spiritual retreat and recreation. The notion of breaking from work periodically took root among the middle and working class."}
