Emily suspects that the parents have been abusing Lillith for her lack of obedience in life. Emily's suspicion is confirmed when Edward and Margaret are planning to incinerate Lillith by gassing her alive in the oven at home. Emily saves Lillith with the help of Detective Mike Barron. Lillith is originally ordered to be sent to the children's home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead. With the agreement of the board, Emily is assigned to take care of Lillith until a suitable foster family comes along. In the meantime, Edward and Margaret are placed in a mental institution for attempted murder.\nNot too long after Lillith moves in, strange things begin to happen around Emily. Two weeks later, another of Emily's cases, a boy named Diego, suddenly murders his parents with a crowbar, and Mike informs Emily that somebody phoned Diego from her house the night before the crime. As she is suspected of involvement in the incident, Lillith undergoes a psychiatric evaluation by Emily's best friend, Douglas J. Ames. During the session, however, Lillith turns the evaluation around, asking Douglas what his fears are and subtly threatening him. That night after receiving a strange phone call, Douglas is panicked by a mass of hornets coming out of his body in hysteria and murders himself in the bathroom.\nEmily gradually becomes fearful of Lillith, so she heads to the mental asylum for answers from Edward and Margaret. They tell her that, far from being truly human, Lillith is actually a Succubus-like demon who feeds on emotion, capable of causing deadly hallucinations based on her victims's fears. The desperate attempt to murder her had been an attempt to save themselves and others. Edward tells Emily that the only way to murder Lillith is to get her to sleep. Shortly after Emily leaves the asylum, Margaret hallucinates being on fire, and Edward is stabbed in the eye after attacking a fellow inmate through whom the voice of Lillith spoke. Mike initially thinks Emily should seek psychiatric help, but is later convinced when he receives a strange phone call in his home from Lillith. He arms himself to help Emily. However, he fatally shoots himself in the head with his shotgun, as Lilith makes him imagine he is being attacked by dogs.\nAfter realizing that her closest colleagues have been eliminated, and that the rest of her cases will be next, Emily  serves Lillith tea spiked with sedative. While Lillith is asleep, Emily sets fire to her house, hoping to get rid of her. However, Lillith apparently escapes unharmed. A police officer offers to escort Emily and Lillith to a temporary place to sleep. As Emily is following the police cars, she suddenly takes a different route and drives her car at a high speed, hoping to bring fear to Lillith. Instead, Lillith forces Emily to relive her childhood memory of her mother, Mrs. Jenkins, driving fast in a rainstorm, and that a truck overturns in their path. Emily fights through the memory, telling herself that it is not real. The image fades, and Lillith herself is frightened that the illusion failed and Emily no longer fears her.\nEmily drives the car off a pier. As the car sinks, Emily struggles to lock a now-demonic Lillith in the trunk. Emily then attempts to swim to the surface. However, Lillith grabs Emily's foot to stop her from swimming away, but luckily, after seconds of struggling, Emily finally breaks free and climbs out of the water as the trapped Lillith screams, sinking deep to the bottom to her death while Emily recovers on the pier."}
