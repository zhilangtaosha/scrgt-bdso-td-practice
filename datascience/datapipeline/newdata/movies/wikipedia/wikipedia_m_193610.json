Carly, planning to introduce Mark to her father, Frank (Don Johnson), is upset that Mark has to go out of town on account of a flood at his Connecticut home, missing their dinner. However, she decides to go to his house to seduce him instead. She is horrified to meet Mark's wife, Kate (Leslie Mann), whom she'd originally assumed to be Mark's housekeeper. While initially hostile, both of the women befriend each other. Kate then discovers that he is still seeing another woman, who she thinks is Carly secretly continuing her previous relationship with Mark. After another fight, they discover together that Mark is seeing a third woman.\nCarly and Kate follow Mark and travel to The Hamptons, where they stay at the house of Kate\u2019s brother, Phil (Taylor Kinney). The duo spies on Mark and find him with his mistress, Amber (Kate Upton) on the beach, and when Mark leaves for the gym the two women inform her that Mark has been cheating on all of them. \nAll three women decide to take revenge on him together. Kate spikes his smoothies with estrogen pills to swell his nipples; has their dog lick his toothbrush before soaking it in their toilet; and adds hair-removal cream into his shampoo. Carly spikes his water with a laxative to cause him to defecate heavy diarrhea. Amber uses an ugly drag queen sexual partner against him.\nIn the course of carrying out the women's vicious pranks, they also discover that Mark has been embezzling money from various startup companies that his workplace helps develop. Meanwhile, Carly begins to connect romantically and feel a bond with Phil. The women\u2019s camaraderie begins to fall apart when Kate finds herself still in love with Mark after sleeping with him again. Carly exposes Mark's fraud before texting him, upsetting Kate and Amber.\nLater Mark goes to the Bahamas on a supposed business trip, and Kate decides to follow and expose him.

He is then locked in a conference room by her assistant and friend, Lydia (Nicki Minaj), and is stunned to see all three women sitting in there together. They proceed to confront him with his infidelities and embezzlement. With Carly as her attorney, Kate presents divorce papers and a list of their assets. She reveals how she, as a CEO, has returned all of Mark's embezzled money to the companies he had robbed from, which saves both of them from prison time but leaves him bankrupt, much to his shock and hysterical outrage. Mark's business partner, Nick (David Thornton), then arrives and acknowledges Kate\u2019s work while firing him.\nThe three women all applaud each other, as Mark excuses himself from them, fuming.
