The novels chronicle the life of a member of the English gentry before, during and after World War I. The setting is mainly England and the Western Front of the First World War, in which Ford had served as an officer in the Welch Regiment, a life he vividly depicts. The individual novels are: \n\nSome Do Not ... (1924)\nNo More Parades (1925)\nA Man Could Stand Up \u2014 (1926)\nLast Post (US title, The Last Post) (1928)The work is a complex tale written in a modernist style (\"it is as modern and modernist as they come\"), which does not concentrate on detailing the experience of war. Robie Macauley, in his introduction to the Borzoi edition of 1950, described it as \"by no means a simple warning as to what modern warfare is like... [but] something complex and baffling [to many contemporary readers]. There was a love story with no passionate scenes; there were trenches but no battles; there was a tragedy without a denouement.\" The novel is about the psychological result of the war on the participants and on society. In his introduction to the third novel, A Man Could Stand Up--, Ford wrote, \"This is what the late war was like: this is how modern fighting of the organized, scientific type affects the mind\". In December 2010, John N. Gray hailed the work as \"possibly the greatest 20th-century novel in English\", and Mary Gordon labelled it as \"quite simply, the best fictional treatment of war in the history of the novel\".\n\n"}
