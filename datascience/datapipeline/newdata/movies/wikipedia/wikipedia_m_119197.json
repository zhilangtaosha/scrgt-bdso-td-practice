{"_movieID": "119197", "source": "wikipedia", "created_utc_dt": "09/14/2019, 12:49:40", "summary": "\"Let It Go\" is a song from Disney's 2013 animated feature film Frozen, whose music and lyrics were composed by husband-and-wife songwriting team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. The song was performed in its original show-tune version in the film by American actress and singer Idina Menzel in her vocal role as Queen Elsa. Anderson-Lopez and Lopez also composed a simplified pop version (with shorter lyrics and background chorus) which was performed by actress and singer Demi Lovato over the start of the film's closing credits. A music video was separately released for the pop version.\nThe song presents the ostracized Queen Elsa, who abandons her kingdom when her uncontrollable ability to generate ice is discovered by the public. Up in the mountains, away from the perplexed townspeople, Elsa realizes that she no longer needs to hide her sole ability, and so declares herself free from the restrictions she has had to endure since childhood. She rejoices in being able to use her power freely, to let her past go. Without this hindrance she appears to have more control over her powers and creates a living snowman and a magnificent ice castle for herself. The song also includes discarding items, most notably her gloves, which her parents gave her to hold back her powers, and taking her tiara off her head and throwing it away, afterwards unraveling her braided hairstyle.\n\"Let It Go\" reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and won both the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2014 and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media in 2015. The song gained international recognition, becoming one of the most globally recorded Disney songs, with numerous covers being recorded in different languages.According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, \"Let It Go\" sold 10.9 million copies in 2014, becoming the year's fifth best-selling song."}
