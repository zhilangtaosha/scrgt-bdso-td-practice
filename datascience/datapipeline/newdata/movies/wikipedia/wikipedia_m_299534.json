It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers, 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and 2018's Avengers: Infinity War, and the twenty-second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse the damage caused by Thanos in Infinity War.\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War \u2013 Part 2. The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015, and by May, Markus and McFeely signed on to write the script for the film. In July 2016, Marvel removed the film's title, and it remained untitled until its official title was revealed in December 2018. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York, and Scotland. With an estimated budget of $356 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.\nAvengers: Endgame was widely anticipated, and Disney backed the film with extensive marketing campaigns. It premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 26, 2019, in IMAX and 3D. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. It grossed nearly $2.8 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, overtaking 2009's Avatar.", "plot": "Twenty-three days after Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to disintegrate half of all life in the universe, Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and returns them to Earth, where they reunite with the remaining Avengers\u2014Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes\u2014and Rocket. Locating Thanos on an otherwise uninhabited planet, they plan to retake and use the Infinity Stones to reverse \"the Snap\", but Thanos reveals he destroyed the Stones to prevent their further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. At the Avengers compound, he explains to Romanoff and Rogers that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing the quantum realm could allow time travel, the three ask Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse Thanos' actions in the present. Stark refuses, thinking of his wife, Pepper Potts, and daughter, Morgan, but relents after looking at a picture of himself and the late Peter Parker. Stark and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes changing the past does not affect their present; any changes instead create branched alternate realities. He and Rocket visit the Asgardian refugees' new home in Norway\u2014New Asgard\u2014to recruit Thor, now overweight and drinking heavily, despondent over his failure to stop Thanos. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, now a vigilante subsequent to the disintegration of his family.\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to New York City in 2012. Banner visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012 Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard, while Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present. Meanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013, extracting the Reality Stone from Jane Foster and retrieving Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. Nebula and Rhodes travel to Morag in 2014 and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can. Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, but Nebula becomes incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with those of her past self. Through this connection, 2014 Thanos learns of his future success and the Avengers' attempts to undo it. He captures Nebula and sends 2014 Nebula to the present in the former's place. Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir in 2014, where the Soul Stone's keeper, the Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing someone they love. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to obtain the Soul Stone.\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a Stark-created gauntlet, which Banner, the most resistant to the Stones' gamma radiation, uses to reverse the disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014 Nebula uses the time machine to transport 2014 Thanos and his warship to the present, where he attacks the Avengers' compound, planning to destroy and rebuild the universe with the Stones. Nebula convinces 2014 Gamora to betray Thanos but fails to convince 2014 Nebula and is forced to kill her. Stark, Thor, and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers fight Thanos but are outmatched. Thanos summons his army from his warship to devastate Earth, but a restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos and his army, alongside Danvers, who destroys Thanos' warship as she arrives. After overpowering the heroes, Thanos seizes the gauntlet, but Stark steals the Stones back and uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, at the cost of his life.\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new ruler of New Asgard and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy. Rogers returns the Infinity Stones and Mjolnir to their original timelines and remains in the past to live with Peggy Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield and mantle on to Sam Wilson.", "cast": "Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man: The benefactor and a member of the Avengers who aids them by using electromechanical suits of armor of his own making. According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was one of the few actors to read the entire screenplay for the film. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that the film would inevitably feature Stark's death both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for...They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\" Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them...because of his heart.\" The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since Captain America: Civil War (2016).\nChris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America: The leader of the Avengers. A World War II veteran, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest.\" Both he and McFeely knew he was going to get \"the dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), with McFeely saying, \"He's postponed a life in order to fulfill his duty. That's why I didn't think we were ever going to kill him. Because that\u2019s not the arc. The arc is, I finally get to put my shield down because I've earned that.\"  Patrick Gorman plays an elderly Steve Rogers.\nMark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk: An Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, possesses enhanced strength and a monstrous appearance. In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature, based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity. Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new...Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\" This concludes a character arc that was established in Thor: Ragnarok and continued in Avengers: Infinity War.\nChris Hemsworth as Thor: An Avenger and the king of New Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in Thor: Ragnarok. In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I\u2019ve wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\" Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\" Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying, \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level...It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\" Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Thor was initially supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of Endgame, but Hemsworth successfully argued to keep Thor's new body.\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: A highly trained spy, Avenger, and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained was stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together...She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in Infinity War; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\" McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\" To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet; all are under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since Iron Man 2 (2010), the film which introduced her character.\nJeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye: A master archer, Avenger, and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who has become a vigilante known as Ronin, following the disappearance of his family. McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in Infinity War following Thanos' snap, however it was moved to Endgame instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\" Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family...And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\u201d\nDon Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine: A former officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor. Cheadle described Rhodes' newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He\u2019s much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes' more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"\nPaul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man: An Avenger and former petty criminal who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale and increase in strength. Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 89. This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018. Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"\nBrie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel: An ex-U.S. Air Force pilot and new Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight. Markus stated that Danvers' powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers', \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\". Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell \u2014 it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\" Larson filmed her scenes for Endgame before beginning work on her solo film Captain Marvel, which was released first. Captain Marvel directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in Endgame and gave Danvers' characterization in the film their blessing.\nKaren Gillan as Nebula: A member of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Avenger, and adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings. After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that Infinity War and Endgame would be adapted from The Infinity Gauntlet, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.\nDanai Gurira as Okoye: A Wakandan traditionalist from the Border Tribe who is the head of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female special forces and T'Challa's bodyguards.\nBenedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts tasked with protecting some of the Kamar-Taj's most valuable relics and books.\nJon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The head of security for Stark Industries and former driver and bodyguard of Tony Stark.\nBradley Cooper as Rocket: A member of the Guardians of the Galaxy and now Avenger who is a genetically-engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics. Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character. Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by Guardians of the Galaxy writer-director and Endgame executive producer James Gunn in the first two Guardians of the Galaxy films, was continued in Infinity War and Endgame, and will conclude in the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.\nGwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts: Stark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries who wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor. Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.\nJosh Brolin as Thanos: An intergalactic warlord from Titan who collected the six Infinity Stones to wipe out half of all life in the universe. Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in Avengers: Infinity War, he is now \"done. He did it. He's retired.\" Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-Infinity War, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death \"reinforced Thanos\u2019s agenda. He was done...it was like, 'If I've got to die, I can die now.'\" Thanos has less screen time in Endgame than in Infinity War, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \u201cWe had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers. In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.Several actors from Infinity War reprise their roles in Endgame, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange, Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther, Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch, Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Letitia Wright as Shuri, William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross,  Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Winston Duke as M'Baku, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw, Jacob Batalon as Ned, Vin Diesel as Groot, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Samuel L.

Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of a deleted scene from Thor: The Dark World and new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.
