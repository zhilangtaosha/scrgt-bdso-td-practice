It is one of the tales in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (The Arabian Nights), and one of the best known\u2014despite not being part of the original Arabic text. It was added to the collection in the 18th century by the Frenchman Antoine Galland, who acquired the tale from Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab. Historians consider Diyab the original author of \"Aladdin\", with the tale partly having been inspired by Diyab's own life. Since it first appeared in the early 18th century, \"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp\" has been one of the best known and most retold of all fairy tales."}
