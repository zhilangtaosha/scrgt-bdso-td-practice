Besides Old Norse \u00de\u00f3rr, extensions of the god occur in Old English as \u00deunor and in Old High German as Donar (runic \u16a6\u16df\u16be\u16a8\u16b1 \u00feonar). All forms of the deity stem from a Common Germanic *\u00deunraz (meaning thunder). \nThor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples, from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania, to the tribal expansions of the Migration Period, to his high popularity during the Viking Age, when, in the face of the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia, emblems of his hammer, Mj\u00f6lnir, were worn and Norse pagan personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.\nDue to the nature of the Germanic corpus, narratives featuring Thor are only attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears throughout Norse mythology. Norse mythology, largely recorded in Iceland from traditional material stemming from Scandinavia, provides numerous tales featuring the god. In these sources, Thor bears at least fifteen names, is the husband of the golden-haired goddess Sif, is the lover of the j\u00f6tunn J\u00e1rnsaxa, and is generally described as fierce eyed, red haired and red bearded. With Sif, Thor fathered the goddess (and possible valkyrie) \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r; with J\u00e1rnsaxa, he fathered Magni; with a mother whose name is not recorded, he fathered M\u00f3\u00f0i, and he is the stepfather of the god Ullr. By way of Odin, Thor has numerous brothers, including Baldr. Thor has two servants, \u00dej\u00e1lfi and R\u00f6skva, rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str (that he eats and resurrects), and is ascribed three dwellings (Bilskirnir, \u00der\u00fa\u00f0heimr, and \u00der\u00fa\u00f0vangr). Thor wields the mountain-crushing hammer, Mj\u00f6lnir, wears the belt Megingj\u00f6r\u00f0 and the iron gloves J\u00e1rngreipr, and owns the staff Gr\u00ed\u00f0arv\u00f6lr. Thor's exploits, including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent J\u00f6rmungandr\u2014and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of Ragnar\u00f6k\u2014are recorded throughout sources for Norse mythology.\nInto the modern period, Thor continued to be acknowledged in rural folklore throughout Germanic-speaking Europe. Thor is frequently referred to in place names, the day of the week Thursday bears his name (modern English Thursday derives from Old English \u00de\u016bnresd\u00e6g, '\u00deunor's day'), and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today, particularly in Scandinavia. Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture. Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in Heathenry."}
