CIA Agent John Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard), believing June is working with Roy, puts her back on the plane. While June is in the plane\u2019s restroom, Roy subdues the passengers and flight crew, all agents sent by Fitzgerald, and crash-lands the plane in a cornfield. He drugs the shocked June, warning that agents will come after her.\nWaking at home, June prepares for her sister April\u2019s (Maggie Grace) wedding, and learns she wants to sell their father's 1966 Pontiac GTO tri-power, which June had planned to restore as a wedding gift. June is picked up by Fitzgerald and his agents. Roy appears, killing numerous agents in a highway chase and rescuing June. She flees to her ex-boyfriend Rodney (Marc Blucas), a firefighter, before Roy arrives and pretends to take June hostage.\nRoy persuades June that she is safer with him, and reveals that he is in possession of the Zephyr, a perpetual energy battery; he had been assigned to guard its inventor, Simon Feck, until Fitzgerald tried to steal the battery, framing Roy. In Brooklyn, June and Roy discover Feck has gone into hiding but left Roy a clue that he is in the Alps. They are attacked by henchmen sent by Spanish arms dealer Antonio Quintana (Jordi Moll\u00e0). Drugged again, June drifts in and out of consciousness as they are captured and then escape to Roy\u2019s off-the-grid island. Accepting a call from her sister, June accidentally leads Quintana's men to the hideaway. Escaping Quintana\u2019s unmanned aerial assault vehicle in a helicopter, Roy knocks June out to circumvent her fear of flying.\nJune wakes up aboard a train in Austria, where Roy has reunited with Simon, and they manage to kill Bernard (Falk Hentschel), an assassin hired by Quintana. After checking into a hotel in Salzburg, June follows Roy to a meeting with Naomi (Gal Gadot), Quintana's henchwoman, where he offers to sell the Zephyr.\nFitzgerald and C.I.A. Director Isabel George (Viola Davis) find June and reveal that Roy used her at the airport to smuggle the Zephyr past security. Heartbroken, June leads the C.I.A. to the hotel. Fleeing across the rooftops, Roy is shot and falls into the river with the Zephyr. Simon is kidnapped from C.I.A. custody by Fitzgerald, the real traitor, to be delivered to Quintana in Spain.\nReturning home, June attends her sister\u2019s wedding, and visits an address Roy had been monitoring, where she meets his parents and learns his real name is Matthew Knight. They believe their son, an Army sergeant and Eagle Scout, was killed in action, and have won various lotteries and sweepstakes they do not remember entering. Leaving a message on her own answering machine declaring that she has the Zephyr, June is taken by Quintana's men to Sevilla. Drugged with a prototype truth serum, June explains that Roy's deal with Quintana was meant to alert the C.I.A. so June would be returned home safely in time for the wedding. Roy, tracking Fitzgerald, rescues June, and leads Quintana and his men on a car chase. Quintana is killed by a bull stampede, and Roy trades Fitzgerald the Zephyr for Simon. Fitzgerald shoots Simon anyway, but Roy takes the bullet instead. Simon reveals that the battery is unstable, and it explodes, killing Fitzgerald.\nRoy is hospitalized in Washington, D.C., where George tells him June has moved on, and welcomes him back to the C.I.A.; however, George\u2019s coded language \u2013 as Roy explained to June earlier \u2013 reveals that he will be killed. June, disguised as a nurse, drugs Roy and breaks him out of the hospital. Waking up in June\u2019s rebuilt GTO, Roy and June drive toward Cape Horn, and Roy's parents unexpectedly receive their own tickets to Cape Horn."}
