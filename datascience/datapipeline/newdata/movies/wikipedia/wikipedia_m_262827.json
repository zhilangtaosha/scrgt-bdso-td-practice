It was the third play written by Garrick, and was first performed on 17 January 1747 at Covent Garden.The play concerns a young woman, Miss Biddy, and her various suitors.Mary Delany saw Miss in Her Teens in 1747 and remarked of the play in correspondence that \"nothing can be lower\". Of Garrick's performance she remarked that \"...the part he acts in himself (Mr. Fribble) he makes so ridiculous that it is very entertaining\" and added that \"It is said that he mimics eleven men of fashion\". A 1798 performance was attended by George III and the British royal family. Eliza Poe, the mother of writer Edgar Allan Poe made her stage debut in Miss in Her Teens at the age of nine, playing Biddy Blair."}
