It is the best known and most successful musical collaboration ever by records sold, with the Beatles selling over 600 million records worldwide as of 2004. Between 5 October 1962 and 8 May 1970, the partnership published approximately 180 jointly credited songs, of which the vast majority were recorded by the Beatles, forming the bulk of their catalogue.\nUnlike many songwriting partnerships that comprise separate lyricist and composer, both Lennon and McCartney wrote lyrics and music. Sometimes, especially early on, they would collaborate extensively when writing songs, working \"eyeball to eyeball\" as Lennon phrased. Later, it was more common for one of the two credited authors to write all or most of a song with limited input from the other. By an agreement made before the Beatles became famous, Lennon and McCartney were credited equally with songs that either one of them wrote while their partnership lasted.\nLennon\u2013McCartney compositions have been the subject of numerous cover versions. According to Guinness World Records, \"Yesterday\" has been recorded by more musicians than any other song."}
