It was based on Another Bullshit Night in Suck City, a memoir by Nick Flynn.", "plot": "Nick Flynn (Dano) is an aspiring writer who works at a homeless shelter where his estranged father Jonathan (De Niro) is a client. Jonathan, an alcoholic ex-con and self-proclaimed \"master storyteller\", left Nick's mother Jody (Moore) years earlier to raise Nick on her own. She eventually committed suicide, for which Nick feels responsible. Jonathan gets into fights with the other clients, and Nick is tempted to throw him out. Nick and Jonathan get into an intense argument, during which Jonathan tells Nick that they are the same. The stress of seeing his father again drives Nick to drink heavily and abuse drugs, costing him his relationship with his girlfriend and coworker, Denise (Olivia Thirlby). \nJonathan eventually gets kicked out of the shelter, with Nick voting with the staff for his removal. Nick tries to numb the guilt by smoking crack, but the drug only intensifies his pain, and he realizes that he has a problem. He enters a rehabilitation program, and makes amends with Denise. One night, he finds Jonathan sleeping on the street and invites him to stay with him. When they part ways the next day, Jonathan tells Nick that he is not responsible for his mother's suicide, and that they are not the same after all. \nNick becomes a teacher, starts a family, and publishes a book of his poetry, while Jonathan qualifies for Section 8 housing thanks to Nick's recommendation. Jonathan shows his appreciation by letting Nick read his \"masterpiece\", Memoirs of a Moron, which Jonathan finds to be initially promising, but ultimately falling short - much like Jonathan himself. He invites Jonathan to his poetry reading, where he introduces his father to his wife and infant daughter. After some hesitation, he allows Jonathan to hold his daughter.", "cast": "Robert De Niro as Jonathan Flynn\nJulianne Moore as Jody Flynn\nPaul Dano as Nick Flynn\nLiam Broggy as Young Nick\nOlivia Thirlby as Denise\nLili Taylor as Joy\nDale Dickey as Marie\nVictor Rasuk as Gabriel\nWes Studi as The Captain\nKatherine Waterston as Sarah"}
