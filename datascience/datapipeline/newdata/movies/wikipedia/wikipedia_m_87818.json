The film was shot over a period of several years, as casting also proved to be a challenge for the producers. Some actors, including George Clooney, declined to take part, while others, such as Richard Gere, attempted to get out of the project.Released on January 25, 2013, Movie 43 was panned by critics, with Richard Roeper calling it \"the Citizen Kane of awful\", joining others who labeled it as one of the worst films of all time. The film won three awards at the 34th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture.", "plot": "Movie 43 is a series of different sketches containing different scenes and scenarios."}
