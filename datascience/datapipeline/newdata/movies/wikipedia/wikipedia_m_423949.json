At work, Kit meets the vice president of the company, Gary, who is extremely awkward and makes inappropriate advances towards her. \nShortly after starting the job, Kit receives a mysterious letter from \"The Salesman\" who invites her to \"The Store,\" the place that sells \"what you need.\" The Salesman offers Kit the chance to fulfill her childhood fantasy of owning a unicorn. Kit must prepare for ownership of a unicorn by meeting specific requirements detailed in files given to her by the Salesman. The first file outlines how to provide an adequate enclosure for the unicorn to live in. Kit hires Virgil, a hardware store employee, to build a stable but does not tell him what she needs it for. Soon, they begin to talk and spend time together. The second file tells Kit she must prepare to feed the unicorn. Kit and Virgil buy hay on a day trip together and get to know each other better.\nGary offers Kit an opportunity to present a marketing pitch for a vacuum cleaner. During this time, Kit receives the next file and learns she must be able to surround the unicorn with a loving environment, but recognizes that her dysfunctional relationship with her parents keeps her from doing so. On the weekend Kit should be preparing her presentation for work, she goes on an \"Emotion Quest\" wilderness trip with her parents and confronts them during the 'truth circle' time, leading to a family discussion. The discussion turns into an argument, furthering tensions between her and her parents.  \nOnce Kit returns home, she finds inspiration for her presentation and begins working through the night. Kit finds out in her next file that she must show that she can provide for the unicorn financially.  \nKit's presentation is flamboyant and is not received well by the business executives, who watch in stunned silence. The executives unanimously opt for a different pitch which features an attractive model. Kit leaves her job. On a date with Virgil, he asks her to reveal the secret of the stable's purpose. Kit tells him about the unicorn store, and she brings him to it, only to find that it is now abandoned.  Kit's confusion turns to anger as she feels betrayed by the Salesman. Virgil becomes concerned for Kit, telling her that she's been conned, but assuring her that he doesn't think she's crazy. Kit exits angrily, and leaves Virgil standing in the store, where he notices a sweep of hay on the ground.\nKit gives up on her dream of owning a unicorn and throws out all of her art and supplies. After a healing moment with her mother, Kit reaches out to Virgil and visits his store, but is unable to get in touch with him. She leaves an apologetic message on his voicemail, and later finds that Virgil has finished the stable, decorating it with the artwork that she had thrown out.  \nThe Salesman calls to let Kit know the unicorn has arrived. When she hesitates, the Salesman tells her there is another woman who is waiting if Kit doesn't come to get it. Virgil urges Kit not to go. Despondent, Kit expresses that if she doesn't go, she will always question her choice. When she arrives, Kit finds that, in fact, the unicorn is there. She talks to the unicorn, thanking him for the times that he was there for her when nobody else was, and finally gains closure. She decides not to take the unicorn with her, and leaves it for the next customer to have. Virgil comes in and sees the unicorn as well. The two leave hand-in-hand, astonished at all they had just experienced.", "cast": "Various crew members appear in brief roles, including: writer Samantha McIntyre as Sam, a woman also seeking a unicorn; composer Alex Greenwald as a ninja; production designer Matt Luem as Jonathan Scott, Kit's art professor; and executive producer Nathan Kelly as David Davidson Jr. Toks Olagundoye and Jack J.
