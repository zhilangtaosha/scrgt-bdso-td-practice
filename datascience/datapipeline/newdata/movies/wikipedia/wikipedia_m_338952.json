But Grindelwald escapes with the aid of  MACUSA employee Abernathy.\nThree months later at the Ministry of Magic in London, Newt Scamander, while working to have his travel ban removed, runs into Leta Lestrange, an old Hogwarts classmate and fianc\u00e9e to his Auror brother, Theseus. The Ministry agree to grant Newt's request on the condition that he aids Theseus in locating Credence Barebone in Paris. Newt declines after learning he is to work with the Auror Grimmson. Later, after being reprimanded by the Ministry for his recent actions, Albus Dumbledore meets with Newt and is revealed to have indirectly sent his former student to America to release Frank the Thunderbird. Dumbledore requests Newt to reach Paris and save Credence from Grindelwald and the Ministry, both believing him to be Leta's long lost brother Corvus Lestrange.\nNewt soon gets an unexpected visit from his American friends Queenie Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski, the latter having retained most of the memories that were erased at the end of the previous film. Queenie reveals that Tina is seeing other people after reading an issue of Spellbound magazine that incorrectly reported that Newt was betrothed to Leta. Newt then deduces that Queenie enchanted Jacob into eloping to circumvent the MACUSA's marriage ban between wizards and non-magical humans. After Newt lifts the charm, Jacob rejects the idea of marrying Queenie out of fear of the consequences she would face, which prompts the upset Queenie to leave to find Tina. Newt and Jacob follow her to Paris after learning Tina is there in search of Credence.\nIn Paris, Tina searches for Credence at the Circus Arcanus. Credence and a female circus freak named Nagini escape after causing a distraction. While searching for Credence's birth mother, he and Nagini locate a half-elf servant called Irma Dugard who placed him for adoption. However Grimmson, who is revealed to be a follower of Grindelwald, arrives and kills Irma. Meanwhile, Tina meets Yusuf Kama, who is also hunting Credence. Newt and Jacob follow Yusuf to Tina, and Yusuf explains that he made an Unbreakable Vow to kill his brother, whom he believes to be Credence. Meanwhile, unable to find Tina, a distraught Queenie is found by one of Grindelwald's followers and brought to him. Grindelwald is aware of Queenie's Legilimens ability, allowing her to leave while manipulating her into joining him in order to marry Jacob.\nNewt and Tina infiltrate the French Ministry of Magic for documents to confirm Credence's identity but Leta and Theseus discover them. Newt and Tina reconcile after he explains he was never engaged to Leta. Their search for information about Credence leads them to the Lestrange family tomb, where they find Yusuf. Yusuf reveals that he is carrying out his father's request to avenge the death of his mother Laurena Kama, who was kidnapped by Corvus's father, who used the Imperius Curse on her, and who died giving birth to Corvus' sister, Leta. But Leta reveals that she unintentionally caused her brother's death by switching him with an infant Credence while en route to America. The group then realize they fell into Grindelwald's trap, finding themselves at his rally, where Queenie is among his followers.\nAt the rally, Grindelwald shows images of an upcoming global war, and rails against the Ministry's laws that prohibit them from preventing such a tragedy from occurring. When Theseus and the Aurors then surround the rally, Grindelwald prompts his followers to disperse across Europe to spread his message. Grindelwald then casts a circle of blue fire that kills his enemies while allowing his most loyal followers, as well as Credence and Queenie, to join him. Leta sacrifices herself to hold off Grindelwald so Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, Nagini, and Theseus can escape. As Grindelwald leaves, the remaining heroes unite alongside the immortal alchemist Nicolas Flamel to subdue and extinguish the fire. Newt realises that he is now embroiled in a conflict with Grindelwald, and can no longer avoid fighting his enemies.\nAt Hogwarts, Newt gives Dumbledore a vial that his Niffler stole from Grindelwald, revealed to contain a blood pact which Grindelwald and Dumbledore made in their youth that prevents them from dueling each other as Dumbledore believes he can destroy it. At his Nurmengard base in Austria, acting on Queenie's advice to win the youth over, Grindelwald reveals Credence's true identity as Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus' long-lost brother and the only person powerful enough to defeat him.", "cast": "Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander:A British Ministry of Magic employee in the Beasts Division of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, as well as a self-proclaimed magizoologist.
