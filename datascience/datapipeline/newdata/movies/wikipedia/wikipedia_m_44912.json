They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers, all of which come from imagination and/or emotions. The characters are typically depicted as members of the Green Lantern Corps, an interstellar law enforcement agency.\nThe first Green Lantern character, Alan Scott, was created in 1940 by Martin Nodell during the Golden Age of Comic Books and usually fought common criminals in New York City with the aid of his magic ring. For the Silver Age of Comic Books, John Broome and Gil Kane reinvented the character as Hal Jordan in 1959 and shifted the focus of Green Lantern stories from fantasy to science fiction. Other notable Green Lanterns include Guy Gardner, John Stewart, and Kyle Rayner.\nThe Green Lanterns are among DC Comics' longer lasting sets of characters. They have been adapted to television, video games, and motion pictures."}
