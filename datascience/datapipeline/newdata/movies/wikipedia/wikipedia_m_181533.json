The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act abnormally, causing massive chaos at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party.\nLarry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. To Larry's surprise, Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila, Jed, Octavius, Dexter and Laaa have come as well, and Laaa is left to stand guard while the others search the museum, the tablet bringing its own exhibits to life.\nThey are joined by a wax Sir Lancelot, who helps them fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a Xiangliu statue and a Triceratops skeleton. Jedediah and Octavius fall through a ventilation shaft but are rescued from an erupting Pompeii model by Dexter. The group find Ahkmenrah's parents, learning the tablet's power can be regenerated by moonlight, since it is empowered through the magic of Khonsu. Lancelot mistakes the tablet for the Holy Grail and steals it, leaving to find Camelot. Larry and Laaa are locked in the employee break room by Tilly, but they escape, and Laaa remains behind to distract Tilly, during which they become attracted to each other.\nLancelot crashes a performance of the musical Camelot, starring Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve as King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, but Larry and the others chase him to the theatre roof, where the New York exhibits begin to die. Lancelot then sees that the quest was about them and gives the tablet back. The moonlight restores the tablet's power, saving the exhibits. They decide that Ahkmenrah and the tablet should stay with his parents, even if it means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Back in New York, Larry says goodbye to everyone, including Roosevelt. The two say their final goodbyes with Teddy making Larry jump. Teddy says, \"Smile, my boy; it's sunrise,\" before he freezes and Larry slowly and sadly leaves the museum, before meeting up with his son, outside.\nThree years later, Larry, having taken the blame for the planetarium incident, thus giving McPhee his job back, now works as a teacher, and a traveling British Museum exhibit comes to New York. Tilly becomes the new night guard, and gives the tablet to Dr. McPhee, showing him its power and allowing the exhibits to awaken again to celebrate Ahkmenrah's reunion. Outside, Larry watches them party inside.", "cast": "Ben Stiller as Larry Daley, a security guard at the American Museum of Natural History.Stiller also plays Laaa, a Neanderthal who resembles Larry.\nRobin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt, the Wax sculpture of the 26th President of the United States.\nOwen Wilson as Jedediah, a cowboy diorama miniature.\nSteve Coogan as Octavius, a Roman soldier miniature.\nRicky Gervais as Dr. McPhee, the director of the Museum of Natural History.\nRachael Harris as Madeline Phelps, the chairwoman of the American Museum of Natural History.\nDan Stevens as Sir Lancelot, the wax statue of the legendary Knight of the Round Table.\nRebel Wilson as Tilly, the night security guard at the British Museum.\nSkyler Gisondo as Nick Daley, the son of Larry Daley.
