Rivele, and Christopher Wilkinson, which interprets the life and compositions of jazz musician Miles Davis. The film stars Cheadle, Emayatzy Corinealdi, and Ewan McGregor, and closed the New York Film Festival on October 11, 2015. The film takes its title from Davis's 1957 album.\nCheadle took a free-form approach to the film's narrative. Skipping around in time, it depicts Davis' attempts to get his career back on track following a period of inactivity and drug addiction in the 1970s, fictional adventures with a journalist (played by McGregor) who wants to profile him, and his troubled marriage to a former dancer (Corinealdi). The film's score covers, in non-linear fashion, Davis' actual recordings throughout his career, beginning with Agharta (1975) before jumping back and forth in scenes featuring Kind of Blue (1959), Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), Bitches Brew (1970), and We Want Miles (1981), among others.Miles Ahead received mostly positive reviews from critics. Reviewers generally praised Cheadle's direction and performance, although some were critical of the plot. The film has grossed over $5 million.\n\n", "plot": "Adapted from Sony ClassicsIn the midst of a prolific career, Miles Davis (Don Cheadle) disappears from public view for a period of five years in the late 1970s. He lives in isolation while dealing with chronic pain from a deteriorating hip, a musical voice inhibited and numbed by drugs and painkillers, and traumatic memories of his past. A music reporter, Dave Braden (Ewan McGregor), forces his way into Davis' house and, over the next couple of days, the two men unwittingly embark on an adventure to recover a stolen tape recording of the musician's most recent compositions.\nDavis' mercurial behavior is fueled by memories of his failed 9-year marriage (1958-1967) to the talented and beautiful dancer Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi). During their romance and subsequent marriage, Frances served as Davis' muse. It was during this period that he released several of his signature recordings, including Sketches of Spain (1960) and Someday My Prince Will Come (1961). The marriage was marked by infidelity and abuse, however, and Frances was forced to flee for her own safety as Miles' mental and physical health deteriorated. By the late 1970s, plagued by years of regret and loss, Davis flirts with self-destruction until he once again finds redemption in his music.", "cast": "Don Cheadle as Miles Davis\nEmayatzy Corinealdi as Frances Taylor\nEwan McGregor as Dave Braden\nMichael Stuhlbarg as Harper Hamilton\nKeith Stanfield as Junior\nAustin Lyon as Justin\nJeffrey Grover as Gil Evans\nJoshua Jessen as Bill Evans\nTheron Brown as Herbie Hancock\nJT Thigpen as Paul Chambers\nDavid Kettlehake as Cab Driver\nMark Angel II as Driver and Background Pedestrian\nDerek Snow as Harold Lovett, Miles' lawyer\nJon \"Swing\" McHale as himself\nMorgan Wolk as Erica\nMark Turkeltaub as Cop #1\nJohn Griffin as Cop #2\nMike Dennis as Beat Cop"}
