Planned as a single performance for 1 July, it was expanded to 10 shows due to the high demand for tickets. It was their first live performance together in 34 years, the first without member Graham Chapman, who died in 1989, and to date it has been their last.\nThe final date was broadcast in cinemas around the world on 20 July. Prior to this Eric Idle stated, \u201cIt is a world event and that\u2019s really quite exciting. It means we\u2019re actually going to say goodbye publicly on one show. Nobody ever has the chance to do that. The Beatles didn\u2019t get a last good night.\u201d"}
