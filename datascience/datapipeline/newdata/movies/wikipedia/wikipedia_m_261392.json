The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Topher Grace, Connie Britton, Walton Goggins, John Leguizamo, Bill Pullman, and Tony Hale. It was released on August 21, 2015, by Lionsgate.\n\n", "plot": "Mike Howell is a stoner who lives in the sleepy town of Liman, West Virginia, where he works as a convenience store clerk. He is planning to propose to his longtime girlfriend, Phoebe Larson, on a trip to Hawaii. However, due to a fear of travel, he suffers intense panic attacks and is unable to board the plane. It is revealed he has had similar issues trying to leave town in the past and does not understand why Phoebe is so nice about it.\nIn Langley, Virginia, CIA Agent Victoria Lasseter receives a coded warning that Mike, the sole survivor of her \"Wiseman\" Ultra program, is to be eliminated by her rival, Adrian Yates, and his similar \"Toughguy\" agents. Feeling a duty to protect Mike, Lasseter travels to Liman and \"activates\" Mike through a series of code words. Mike fails to understand their significance, and she leaves in resigned frustration.\nMike finds two Toughguys planting a bomb in his car and is attacked, but his training activates and he quickly kills them. Horrified, he calls Phoebe, who reaches him just as Sheriff Watts arrives. Yates sends two Toughguy operatives, Laugher and Crane, to kill Mike and Phoebe at the sheriff station, but they evade Laugher and kill Crane before escaping to the home of Mike's drug dealing friend Rose. Mike becomes unnerved by an array of facts he suddenly knows regarding military strategy. He also realises he has very little memory prior to living in the town with Phoebe, wondering aloud why he never questioned this before.\nYates places the city under quarantine, and puts Lasseter and Mike's pictures on the local news. Lasseter contacts her former assistant, Petey Douglas, to air drop her a weapon. Yates finds out and threatens Petey with charges of treason, causing Petey to deny her further help. Yates then attacks Rose's house with two Toughguys using a lethal gas. The agents kill Rose and his two guards, Big Harold and Wuinzin, before Mike and Phoebe kill the attackers and she rescues Mike from the gas, which she is familiar with. When pressed for answers on her knowledge of the gas, Phoebe reluctantly reveals she was a CIA agent assigned to be Mike's handler, leaving him heartbroken.\nLaugher ambushes the duo and captures Phoebe. Mike is rescued by Lasseter and insists on returning to his house. She tells him that he volunteered for Wiseman due to his criminal record and subsequently had his memories erased. He also learns that Phoebe was to get him settled in Liman and then leave, but chose to stay because she genuinely fell in love. Lasseter also explains that his phobias, including his fear of leaving town, were implanted to keep him safe.\nYates\u2019 army liaison, Otis, joins a  Toughguy to attack Mike\u2019s house. Mike and Lasseter kill them, prompting Yates to order a drone strike on the entire block. Petey launches the drone but eventually refuses to fire its missile, then secretly reports the situation to Yates' superior, Raymond Krueger.\nMike contacts Yates and arranges to exchange himself for Phoebe at a local grocery store. He attacks the store, killing or incapacitating multiple Toughguys before fighting and defeating Laugher, whom he spares when Mike learns he is a mentally unbalanced man forcibly conscripted by Yates. Phoebe escapes from Yates when Lasseter attacks him, but Krueger arrives and stops her.\nPhoebe and Mike leave the store under gunpoint of multiple law enforcement officers, before he proposes to her.\nIn a forested area, Krueger has Yates and Lasseter bound and kneeling. Yates argues that what he was doing would have been okay with Krueger, despite the deaths of seven innocent sheriffs, if the results had been successful, and Krueger agrees. Yates, missing the \"successful\" codicil, smugly smiles and stands, but is executed by Krueger. Krueger admits he informed Lasseter of Yates\u2019 plan, and she points out that, by taking out 17 Toughguys, Mike is proof of the success of her Wiseman program.\nSix months later, handled by Lasseter and Petey, Mike and Phoebe are in Manila, confident and happy together as they carry out a CIA assignment.", "cast": "Jesse Eisenberg as Mike Howell\nKristen Stewart as Phoebe Larson\nTopher Grace as Adrian Yates\nConnie Britton as Victoria Lasseter\nWalton Goggins as Laugher\nJohn Leguizamo as Rose\nBill Pullman as Raymond Krueger\nTony Hale as Petey Douglas\nLavell Crawford as Big Harold\nStuart Greer as Sheriff Watts\nMonique Ganderton as Crane"}
