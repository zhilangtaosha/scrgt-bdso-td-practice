It is a vector quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction in three-dimensional space. If m is an object's mass and v is the velocity (also a vector quantity), then the momentum is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n        \n        =\n        m\n        \n          v\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {p} =m\\mathbf {v} ,}\n  In SI units, it is measured in kilogram meters per second (kg\u22c5m/s). Newton's second law of motion states that a body's rate of change in momentum is equal to the net force acting on it.\nMomentum depends on the frame of reference, but in any inertial frame it is a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum does not change. Momentum is also conserved in special relativity (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form,  in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity. It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time: translational symmetry.\nAdvanced formulations of classical mechanics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. In these systems the conserved quantity is  generalized momentum, and in general this is different from the kinetic momentum defined above. The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a wave function. The momentum and position operators are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\nIn continuous systems such as electromagnetic fields, fluids and deformable bodies, a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the Navier\u2013Stokes equations for fluids or the Cauchy momentum equation for deformable solids or fluids."}
