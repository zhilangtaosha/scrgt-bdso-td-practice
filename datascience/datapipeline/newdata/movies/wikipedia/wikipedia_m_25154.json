Shot primarily in and around Wilmington and New Hanover County, North Carolina in early 2007, the film is centered on Marc Pease, a man living in the past, when he was the star of his high school's musicals. The film stars Jason Schwartzman as Pease, Ben Stiller as Marc's former mentor, and Anna Kendrick as his love interest.", "plot": "In high school, Marc Pease (Jason Schwartzman) ran out on his performance as the Tin Man in a production of The Wiz, succumbing to his stage fright despite his mentor Mr. Jon Gribble's (Ben Stiller) encouragement. Eight years later, he is dating Meg Brickman (Anna Kendrick), a high school senior who is bitter about being in the chorus and not having a principal role in Gribble's latest production of The Wiz. Marc is keen for Gribble to produce the demo tape for his a cappella singing group Meridian 8 (which has already lost four of eight original members). Gribble, however, tries to avoid Marc, frustrated that Marc refuses to leave him alone because of the friendly advice he gave Marc eight years ago.\nWhile tidying Meg's bedroom, Marc finds a tape labelled \"Meg singing\", but discovers after he listens to it that she is singing with Gribble, and at the end of the song, their noises suggest that they are having sex. Meg, meanwhile, begins to doubt Gribble's sincerity when he tells her what a terrific singer she is when she realizes that she is always in the chorus. Questioning whether she even enjoys singing, she decides to quit. Marc drives to a performance with Meridian 8, where the only way he can keep the group from splitting up is to lie that Gribble has given them the chance to record in a studio. After insisting that he should sing his Tin Man's song, he starts crying on stage, and is later forced to admit that Gribble has not yet responded to his request to produce the demo. That night, the opening night of The Wiz, Marc is working as a chauffeur for a high school prom couple. After dropping them off and cutting off his frequently ridiculed ponytail, he arrives at the show in the interval. He unsuccessfully tries to discuss Meridian 8's demo with Gribble, who brushes him off, then learns from another bandmate that they are losing another member.\nAfter hearing the Tin Man's song from outside the auditorium, Marc goes inside and drags Gribble out into an empty classroom. Marc confronts him about his empty promises for Meridian 8 to record in a studio. Gribble tells Marc that he is still living as if he were in high school, and an angered Marc threatens to play Meg's tape to the school principal and expose Gribble's affair with a student. As they fight, Marc accuses Gribble of denying Meg a main role as a means of revenge on him, and destroys the tape for Meg's sake. He then goes backstage and breaks up with Meg because she is too young for him. Seeing that the actor of the Wiz has injured himself, Marc takes his cape, runs onto the stage and sings the Wiz's song. Meg runs away but decides that she loves singing and returns to the stage. Marc's performance is met with cheers from the audience, and he is overjoyed.\nOne year later, having left exorcised his Wizard of Oz demons, Marc is working as a professional singer under the title \"The Marc Pease Experience\".", "cast": "Jason Schwartzman as Marc Pease.\nBen Stiller as Mr. Jon Gribble, Marc's overzealous former mentor.\nAnna Kendrick as Meg Brickman, a high school senior, romantically involved with both Pease and Gribble.\nJay Paulson as Gerry\nEbon Moss-Bachrach as Gavin\nGabrielle Dennis as Tracey\nAmber Wallace as Ilona\nShannon Holt as Debbie\nAustin Herring as Mr. Edwards\nKelen Coleman as Stephanie\nJoe Inscoe as Mr. Brickman\nMatt Cornwell as Rick Berger\nDamien Haas as Techie\nTyler Easter as The Lion\nBrittney McNamara as Dorothy\nJared Grimes as The Wiz\nDylan Hubbard as The Tinman\nChaz McNeil as Brendan/The Scarecrow"}
