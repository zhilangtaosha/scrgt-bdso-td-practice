The video prominently featured references to Fortnite Battle Royale and starred YouTubers and online celebrities such as Ninja and Marques Brownlee, as well as celebrities like Will Smith, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver. It is the first video in the YouTube Rewind series to feature a combination of animation and live-action sequences.\nYouTube Rewind 2018 was heavily panned by critics, YouTubers, and viewers alike, who subsequently dubbed it the worst YouTube Rewind video to date. The video was criticized for obscure trending or unpopular YouTubers; lack of tributes to recent deaths such as Stephen Hawking, Aretha Franklin, Stef\u00e1n Karl Stef\u00e1nsson, Avicii, TotalBiscuit, Stephen Hillenburg and Stan Lee; and exclusion of many prominent YouTubers of the year such as Shane Dawson, MrBeast and PewDiePie, as well as popular rivalries such as KSI vs Logan Paul and PewDiePie vs T-Series. However, the animation (especially Jaiden Animations' scene depicting her riding on PewDiePie's chair) was praised and Will Smith's reactions in the video became an Internet meme.\nYouTube Rewind 2018 amassed 29.4 million views within 24 hours of release, making it the 13th most-viewed YouTube video in the first 24 hours. As of August 30, 2019, it has over 179 million views and over 16 million dislikes, making it the most-disliked YouTube video, a record that was held by the music video by Justin Bieber's \"Baby\" for eight years.", "cast": "Below is a list of starring cast members in YouTube Rewind 2018, derived from the video's description:\n\na  Animation only\nn  Debut in YouTube Rewind"}
