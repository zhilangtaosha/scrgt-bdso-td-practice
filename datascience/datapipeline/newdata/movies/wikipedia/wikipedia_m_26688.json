While having sex with him, Megan fakes her death. Garrett and the girls bring her to a lake, where they intend to dump her body. When Jessica mentions they need to release the air out of her lungs so that her body will not float to the surface, Garrett stabs Megan in the chest with a tire iron, resulting in her actual death. Garrett and the girls cover up the incident and dump Megan's body and the tire iron in a nearby mine shaft. Everyone swears to never mention the incident to anyone, much to Cassidy and Ellie's dismay. \nEight months later, the girls are graduating from college and Cassidy has grown apart from the rest of the group. After the ceremony, the girls all receive a text message on their cell phones with a picture of the bloody tire iron. Suspicion immediately falls on Garrett, but Chugs defends him. Maggie (Caroline D'Amore), Megan's younger sister, arrives wanting to honor her sister's memory. Later, Chugs arrives for her appointment with her therapist. However, a cloaked figure wielding a tire iron murders both of them.\nIn the sorority's shower room, Claire and Jessica talk about the night Megan was murdered. After they leave, a sorority girl named Joanna, who overheard their conversation, is murdered. At the graduation party that night, Claire's ex-boyfriend Mickey is attacked and murdered by the killer, which Ellie witnesses. Cassidy, Claire, Jessica, and Ellie regroup and all receive a text containing the video of Megan's death and a message telling them to be at the mine shaft in twenty minutes or the video will be sent to the police. The girls drive to the mine shaft and encounter Garrett, who has cut his wrists and begins threatening them. Thinking Garrett is the one stalking them, Jessica runs him over with her vehicle. They discover afterward that Garrett has been receiving the same text messages they have. Ellie suspects that Megan is the killer, believing that she did not actually die and is seeking revenge. The girls lower Cassidy down the shaft to prove that Megan is dead. Megan's body is missing and Cassidy finds a message written in blood which reads, \"Theta Pi must die\". \nBack at the now empty sorority house, the girls receive a text from Chugs' cell phone telling them that she is dead and Claire is murdered with a flare gun. While searching the house for Jessica's boyfriend, Kyle (Matt Lanter), the girls run into Maggie and their house mother, Mrs. Crenshaw (Carrie Fisher). Maggie claims that Kyle had been with her prior to Jessica's return. Jessica confesses Megan's murder, infuriating Maggie and Mrs. Crenshaw. Mrs. Crenshaw tells the girls to lock themselves in Jessica's bedroom and to call the police while she searches for the killer. Maggie leaves the room to find Megan and convince her to stop killing. After many failed attempts to shoot the killer, Mrs. Crenshaw is killed by the hooded figure. With no cell phones around, Cassidy and Jessica decide to find Mickey's body and use his. Downstairs, the killer confronts Maggie and throws a Molotov cocktail at her, setting the house on fire. Cassidy and Jessica run into Kyle, who injures Jessica. After knocking him unconscious, Cassidy and Jessica flee to an under-renovation bathroom where they find Megan's decomposing corpse hanging in the shower. Kyle, wearing the same cloak as the killer, finds them and knocks Jessica unconscious. He is killed with an axe by Andy (Julian Morris), Cassidy's boyfriend. Jessica regains consciousness and Cassidy realizes that Andy is the killer. Andy stabs Jessica in the mouth with a tire iron, killing her. Andy explains that he had hoped for a bright future with Cassidy, but because she was involved with Megan's death, he feared that she would be found out, so he decided to kill everyone who knew about it. Andy reveals that Ellie was the one who confided in him about Megan's murder and will likely report it to the police, and tells Cassidy they need to kill Ellie. Cassidy plays along and tells Andy that Ellie is in the basement.\nCassidy fetches Ellie from upstairs but they are discovered and attacked by Andy. Cassidy stuns Andy but hears Maggie screaming for help, who is trapped behind the flames. As Andy attempts to kill Maggie, the floor then crumbles underneath Cassidy and she is left hanging over the burning basement. Andy is about to finish her off when Ellie appears and shoots him with Mrs. Crenshaw's shotgun. He falls backward onto the burning floor, which collapses underneath him and he falls to his death into the flames. Maggie and Ellie save Cassidy and the three girls escape from the burning sorority house just as the fire department arrives. \n18 months later, the sorority house is being renovated from the fire and Maggie is now a Theta Pi sister. A man comes into view and the camera reveals scars on his wrists, implying that Garrett is still alive.", "cast": "Briana Evigan as Cassidy Tappan\nLeah Pipes as Jessica Pierson\nRumer Willis as Ellie Morris\nJamie Chung as Claire Wen\nMargo Harshman as Charlene \"Chugs\" Bradley\nJulian Morris as Andy Richards\nAudrina Patridge as Megan Blaire\nCaroline D'Amore as Maggie Blaire\nCarrie Fisher as Mrs. Crenshaw\nMatt O'Leary as Garrett Bradley\nMatt Lanter as Kyle Tyson\nMaxx Hennard as Mickey\nRick Applegate as Senator Tyson\nKen Bolden as Dr. Rosenburg\nNicole Moore as Joanna\nDeja Kreutzberg as Riley\nNatalia Dove as Bucky\nDebra Gordon as Mrs. Tappan"}
