Not just an eye-opener, but a game-changer. Richard Williams demanded nothing less, investing nearly three decades into his movie masterpiece. From as early as 1964 he ploughed most of the profits right back into his pet project, a feature inspired by the Arabian Nights and provisionally known as Mullah Nasruddin. He assembled a team of inspired young artists\u2014and brought in the best Hollywood craftsmen to teach them\u2014and devised what would be the most elaborate, kaleidoscopic, mind-boggling visual sequences ever committed to celluloid. Years passed. Potential financiers came and went. Work continued. But it was only after Roger Rabbit that Williams had a studio budget to corroborate the munificence of his imagination.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/rGQoBcaPnqUgxFInzrEEq9dfG10.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2012-10-04", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 83, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The untold story of the greatest animated film never made.", "title": "Persistence of Vision", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.7, "vote_count": 3, "_movieID": "137845", "_source": "themoviedb", "created_utc_dt": "09/14/2019, 13:55:51"}
