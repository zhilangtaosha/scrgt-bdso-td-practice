In 1975, Irish immigrant Denis Mulcahy of the NYPD bomb squad  \u2013 gathered a group of family, friends and neighbours to start a scheme offering children from Northern Ireland a chance to temporarily escape the violent turmoil of their daily lives. From modest beginnings, Project Children ultimately brought over 20,000 Catholic and Protestant children to suburban US for summer-long visits where they forged unexpected friendships and found they had more in common with the 'enemy' than they thought. Now this extraordinary untold story is being brought to the screen in a new documentary by Des Henderson, and narrated by Liam Neeson, entitled How To Defuse A Bomb: The Project Children Story.", "popularity": 0.93, "poster_path": "/kqvXJmXDd4gsbb8b3zKJM4qnb9e.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 92110, "logo_path": null, "name": "Alleycats TV", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IE", "name": "Ireland"}], "release_date": "2016-09-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "How to Defuse a Bomb: The Project Children Story", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 2, "_movieID": "464933", "_source": "themovedb", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 09:44:19"}
