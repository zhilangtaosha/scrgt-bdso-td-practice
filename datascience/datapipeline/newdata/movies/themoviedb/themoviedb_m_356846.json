The fastest-selling entertainment product in history comes not from Silicon Valley, but is driven by a bunch of British game designers. Friends since their school days, they are led by the game's mastermind-designer, Sam Houser. By 2002, Sam and his creative team have constructed for their fans a vast virtual world, teeming with a high-octane mix of criminal characters, lethal weapons and outrageous storylines. Here you can even shape and sculpt your avatar, crafting their character and appearance to your personal preference.  This drama is for an adult audience and has not been authorised by the producers of Grand Theft Auto. Rather, it is based on court documents and interviews with many of those involved in the real events behind this compelling story.", "popularity": 2.481, "poster_path": "/7Onv5siQpT4MGB5c526aFZ18RBK.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 3712, "logo_path": "/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png", "name": "BBC Scotland", "origin_country": "GB"}, {"id": 288, "logo_path": "/wdmwQuV4R1MIr8A78izZkC184uC.png", "name": "BBC Films", "origin_country": "GB"}, {"id": 3324, "logo_path": "/16fY7pucCzn7WSOYxOGRHlAayL3.png", "name": "BBC", "origin_country": "GB"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2015-09-15", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "nl", "name": "Nederlands"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The tale of one of the most controversial video games of all time.", "title": "The Gamechangers", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 34, "_movieID": "356846", "_source": "themoviedb", "created_utc_dt": "09/14/2019, 14:16:40"}
