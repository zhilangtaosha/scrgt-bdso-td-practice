But in her sharply researched, deftly humorous message of hope, survivor Meghan O\u2019Hara (Oscar-nominated producer of \u201cBowling for Columbine, \u201cFahrenheit 9/11,\u201d and \u201cSicko\u201d) changes the way we think about this terrifying disease, showing that it\u2019s time to stop being afraid of cancer and time to make cancer afraid of us. Following her diagnosis, O\u2019Hara met neurologist Dr. David Servan-Schreiber, who was diagnosed with brain cancer while doing cancer research. Together they explore daily Western behaviors that are linked to 70% of cancer deaths: smoking, processed foods, stress, contaminants, and lack of exercise. Narrated and executive produced by Morgan Freeman, \u201cThe C Word\u201d is an unflinching look at our complacency with cancer culture, the vibrant cast of characters who are changing the game, and the tools we already have to beat the dreaded scourge of our time. -TCFF database", "popularity": 2.022, "poster_path": "/lLlhBwepQ8MzEKaS2FB6vY6mGEj.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 906, "logo_path": "/gN893tmlrcVvWiWCBZEVAiZHpvT.png", "name": "Revelations Entertainment", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 78503, "logo_path": null, "name": "Honest Engine TV", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2016-07-28", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "It's time for Cancer to be afraid of us...", "title": "The C Word", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 7, "_movieID": "403579", "_source": "themovedb", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 07:32:33"}
