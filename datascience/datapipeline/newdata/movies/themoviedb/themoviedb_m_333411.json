We asked them each to write a single line for us \u2014 not a scene, a script or a scenario, but simply an intriguing, amusing or captivating line of dialogue.  Then we gave these lines to one of the great movie artists of our time: the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, a two-time Oscar winner. Kaminski used these lines as inspiration to create 11 original (very) short films. Each short evokes a style or genre of the cinematic past and stars an actor who gave an especially memorable performance in 2013.", "popularity": 1.003, "poster_path": "/j2nNchRu2GZqOGmNY8Ayx7cmw0n.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 32686, "logo_path": "/6sDPxaKC0rGfxeWueXsYXu5YlDU.png", "name": "The New York Times", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2013-11-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 10, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The year's best big-screen performers in 11 original (very) short films.", "title": "Making a Scene", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 4, "_movieID": "333411", "_source": "themovedb", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 09:51:09"}
