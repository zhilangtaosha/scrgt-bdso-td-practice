As the war works a profound change on Europe, and Chrissy is badly wounded in France, the conflict shatters and rearranges the lives of all three principals, as well as virtually everyone else in their elite circle.", "popularity": 0.909, "poster_path": "/x10tfU2V7OezWBQY7IM0kHfuxxP.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 5100, "logo_path": "/7Bq9XfupdptpPYabjy7uQS5aMo.png", "name": "Mammoth Screen", "origin_country": "GB"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2012-08-24", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 287, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Parade's End", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 9, "_movieID": "497997", "_source": "themovedb", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 09:05:37"}
