Returning to California at the age of 21, she was working as a model when she auditioned for a big part in _The Mask (1994)_ (qv). To her amazement and despite having no previous acting experience, she was cast as the female lead in the film opposite 'Jim Carrey' (qv). Over the next 3 years, she honed her acting skills in such low budget independent films as _The Last Supper (1995)_ (qv); _Feeling Minnesota (1996)_ (qv); and _Head Above Water (1996)_ (qv).
