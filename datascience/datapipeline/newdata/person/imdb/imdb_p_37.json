You can't wish you hadn't done something after doing it.", "[on his offensive faux pas of using the term \"colored actors\" instead of \"actors of color\" in an interview] I'm devastated to have caused offence by using this outmoded terminology. I offer my sincere apologies. I make no excuse for my being an idiot and know the damage is done. I can only hope this incident will highlight the need for correct usage of terminology that is accurate and inoffensive. The most shaming aspect of this for me is that I was talking about racial inequality in the performing arts in the UK and the need for rapid improvements in our industry when I used the term. I feel the complete fool I am and while I am sorry to have offended people and to learn from my mistakes in such a public manner please be assured I have. I apologize again to anyone who I offended for this thoughtless use of inappropriate language about an issue which affects friends of mine and which I care about deeply.", "[on the need for a female and then a homosexual president in the United States] You need to have a female president next, and then after that, a gay president. That's the full journey from Obama's legacy onwards. There's a great 'Morrissey' (qv) lyric from \"America Is Not the World\" from You Are the Quarry that goes, \"In America, the land of the free, they said / And of opportunity, in a just and truthful way / But where the president is never black, female or gay, and until that day / You've got nothing to say to me, to help me believe.\" It's quite an old song from before Obama took office, but you've done black, then you need to do female, then the next, gay.", "Like all of these things, like a lot of art, you do the work and you let go. You understand how the thing works and then you let go of it. It should be something you breathe or you feel, not something that you force or try to control. Looking for happiness is a sure way to sadness, I think. You have to take each moment as it comes.", "What fascinates me about a character's suffering is that my own life experiences are far removed from those of my characters and, thankfully, the opposite. It's part of an actor's job to be interested in psychology. However, my knowledge about what drives and motivates human beings in life is still quite immature. I continue to learn and don't have all the answers. These roles inspire me to become a better and more honest human being - whatever that means.", "I think it's deadly to judge your character if you're portraying someone. You have to inhabit it with a certain amount of understanding or empathy, or sympathy or whatever you want to call it. And to fulfill that, it's not about coming down on sides. It's not about journalistic headlines, or black-and-white truth versus fiction, or good against evil - it's much more complex than that.", "I've given up smoking. Although I shouldn't say that, because if I ever have a cigarette again and it'll be all over the place, 'Oh he lied.' But, touch wood, I haven't smoked for a month now and it's really helping."], "birth date": "1976-07-19", "birth notes": "Hammersmith, London, England, UK", "_actorID": "37", "_source": "IMDB", "actorID": "1212722", "created_utc_dt": "09/14/2019, 13:01:46"}
