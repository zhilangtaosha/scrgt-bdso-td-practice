That's the title of my autobiography - 'I Turned Beckett Down.' But I just froze. I look back and I can't call up Federico now and say, 'I changed my mind. Will you work with me?'", "[on first turning down _The Graduate (1967)_ (qv)] It was like a bad dream for me. And it came at a time when I was beginning to get work off-Broadway as an actor and I'd just been in a hit and I'd gotten awards and I thought for the rest of my life my dream will come true: I will be an off-Broadway actor for the rest of my life. And that would have been enough. More than enough. Steady employment was the goal. If God had come down at that moment and said to me or 'Gene Hackman' (qv) or 'Robert Duvall' (qv), 'Sign a contract here that says \"You're never going to be successful, you're never going to have a lead, you're never going to be rich and famous, you will never be on Broadway, you will never be in the West End - you'll be not even off, but off-off-off-Broadway, but you will never see a day without work' - we would have signed on the dotted line in a New York minute.", "Someone once said to me, 'Some of us choose to live with a lifeboat just a little bit out of our reach.' I'd like to reach a point where I no longer bullshit myself. I think that's the natural human condition - to lie to yourself. Because the truth is painful.", "[on 'Meryl Streep' (qv)]: She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing.", "[1974] The Academy 'Awards' (qv) are obscene, dirty and no better than a beauty contest.", "[on the financial success of 'All the President's Men'] The reason for the success of this picture is that Hoffman's back and Redford's got him. It's what the public always wanted: that beautiful WASP finally wound up with a nice Jewish boy.", "[Glancing at his Oscar for _Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)_ (qv)] He has no genitalia and he's holding a sword. I'd like to thank my mother and father for not practicing birth control.", "[on winning the Academy Award] We are part of an artistic family.There are sixty thousand actors in the Screen Actors Guild who don't work. You have to practice accents while you're driving a taxicab 'cause when you're a broke actor you can't write and you can't paint. Most actors don't work and few of us are lucky to have a chance. And to that artistic family that strives for excellence, none of you have ever lost, and I am proud to share this with you, and I thank you.", "[on his role of Dorothy in _Tootsie (1982)_ (qv)] I feel cheated never being able to know what it's like to get pregnant, carry a child and breast-feed.", "Movies are a bastard art form, period. Art, I would think, is the first day you don't start with chapter 25, then jump to the beginning, then jump to the end, and it's all set in concrete, and a script is never what the movie turns out to be. It's either better or worse, but it's a blueprint. When you're painting a picture or writing, you know as well as anyone, you have the general feeling of it but it begins to tell you where it's going. This is the first time I've ever had that opportunity. That is extraordinary. 'Michael Mann' (qv) said he looks at the work, and it starts to influence [him]: We could go there, we could go there, we could go there. I've never had that experience before. As far as it inhabiting me, it doesn't. I don't take the character [home], I've never really understood that personally. You're pretending.", "It's very hard to do your best work, but you want a shot at it. You cannot get a shot at doing your best work in the studio system. You can't. There's committees, there's meetings, you're on the set, you don't have to do that, they get involved in a quasi-creative way but they buck heads with people they shouldn't be bucking heads with. With HBO, once they give a go, there's no committee, no meetings. I was expecting 20 pages a day. I was expecting an atmosphere like making movies on cocaine or speed. It's the opposite. We did the best we could with as much time as we could, and came back the next day. 'Michael Mann' (qv) hired all film directors. There was no difference between making a movie, except he used digital and three cameras, which actors love because we don't have to repeat.", "[on his _Luck (2011)_ (qv) character Chester \"Ace\" Bernstein] I think he tells the truth, and yet he's very intimidating. He's not believed. In the world that he lives in, telling the truth is the last thing they're going to believe. 'Paddy Chayefsky' (qv) said to me many, many years ago when he was researching for _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv), he says, \"I'll take the mob any day, because if you don't keep your word, they kill you. So you keep your word. I just got to know a little bit about Hollywood. There is no moral compass because no one keeps your word because no one's going to kill them. They're just going to get sued.

I shouldn't say that, because my wife ['Lisa Gottsegen' (qv)]'s father was a \"degenerate\" [a nickname for a regular gambler], and my wife went to the track with him when she was 6 years old. My wife has told me everything I have to know about the track, because as a child, she'd learn it from her father, who was a degenerate. When my wife was 5 or 6 years old, she went out to Santa Anita every day with him, and she held a piece of paper and she would look at her dad and say, \"See that horse? Write down KS,\" and she knew that stood for \"kidney sweat\" [a sign of a nervous or sick horse], and that was her job for about three years.", "[on playing a shady racetrack ex-con in _Luck (2011)_ (qv)] I don't have a gangster phone book or anything like that. I live in a certain milieu, that's called 'Hollywood' euphemistically, in which you are are continually lied to and screwed with. I'd much rather be with the mob because, if they promise you something, they keep their word. In Hollywood nobody keeps their word. Everybody lies to you because it doesn't cost them their life.

I knew that 'Rod Steiger' (qv) was going to win for _In the Heat of the Night (1967)_ (qv), and I knew I was not going to win for _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv) because 'John Wayne' (qv) was a sentimental favorite for _True Grit (1969)_ (qv). And he won, as he should have, by the way, because I somehow feel they make more sense when they give you an award for a body of work... I actually remember walking up the aisle, and I'd had a few drinks, when I was nominated for _Tootsie (1982)_ (qv). I was a little late getting there. Everybody was seated, and the show was just beginning, and I'm walking down the aisle and 'Paul Newman' (qv) was on my right. He was nominated (for _The Verdict (1982)_ (qv)) I leaned over and said to him, with three drinks in me, I whispered in his ear, \"We're not gonna win.\" And he smiled because everyone knew 'Ben Kingsley' (qv) was going to win for _Gandhi (1982)_ (qv). There's never been a time, thankfully, where I thought, \"Man, I think I'm gonna win this, and then I didn't.\"", "[in a 2008 interview, on whether he ever googled himself] No, and it's not out of modesty. It's 'cause I don't belong in the 21st Century. I really never got far into the technology since the dial phone. It's all very tough for me.
