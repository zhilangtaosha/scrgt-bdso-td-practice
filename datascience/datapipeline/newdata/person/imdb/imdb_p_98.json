She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole's father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents' native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole's first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member 'Jane Campion' (qv) (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite _Bush Christmas (1983)_ (qv). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in _BMX Bandits (1983)_ (qv) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries _Vietnam (1987)_ (qv) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite 'Sam Neill' (qv) in the at-sea thriller _Dead Calm (1989)_ (qv).Kidman's next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as 'Tom Cruise' (qv)'s doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance _Days of Thunder (1990)_ (qv), she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film _Flirting (1991)_ (qv), then as 'Dustin Hoffman' (qv)'s moll in the gangster flick _Billy Bathgate (1991)_ (qv). She reunited with Cruise for _Far and Away (1992)_ (qv), the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite 'Michael Keaton' (qv) in the tear-tugger _My Life (1993)_ (qv). Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing 'Val Kilmer' (qv) in _Batman Forever (1995)_ (qv), but achieved her real breakthrough with 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, 'Jane Campion' (qv), on the adaptation of 'Henry James' (qv)'s _The Portrait of a Lady (1996)_ (qv). A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in _The Peacemaker (1997)_ (qv), adding \"action star\" to her professional repertoire.She and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv)'s sexual thriller _Eyes Wide Shut (1999)_ (qv). The couple's on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise's homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, 'Antonia Kidman' (qv), discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001.::IMDb Editors"], "spouse": ["'Keith Urban' (qv)::(25 June 2006 - present) ( 2 children)", "'Tom Cruise' (qv)::(24 December 1990 - 8 August 2001) ( divorced) ( 2 children)"], "trade mark": ["Statuesque, model-like figure", "Her independent films often feature the theme of grief and sorrow, such as _Birth (2004)_ (qv) and _Rabbit Hole (2010)_ (qv)", "Often portrays upper-class women in epics, such as Ada Monroe in _Cold Mountain (2003)_ (qv), Marisa Coulter in _The Golden Compass (2007)_ (qv), Lady Sarah Ashley in _Australia (2008)_ (qv) and Gertrude Bell in _Queen of the Desert (2015)_ (qv).", "Radiant, alabaster skin"], "trivia": ["2000: She and her husband 'Tom Cruise' (qv) donated to 'Hillary Clinton' (qv)'s campaign for a seat in the U.S. Senate representing New York state.", "Suffered a broken rib while rehearsing a dance routine for the movie _Moulin Rouge!

I used to fill whole notebooks with my writings.", "My parents thought it was nice to develop my imagination, but they never seriously thought that anything would ever come of it. They said that I couldn't be an actress because I would be taller than all my leading men, so I thought I would be a writer instead.", "It was very natural for me to want to disappear into dark theater, I am really very shy. That is something that people never seem to fully grasp because, when you are an actor, you are meant to be an exhibitionist.", "Do you know I'm always scared that one day I'll look back and say \"God they were the best years of my life and now what?\" There are moments when you feel as if you have been blessed for a while, moments when you think this is perfect, moments when you start to believe that even for an hour, even for a year, it might all happen.

In the end, Gellhorn out-Hemingways Hemingway.", "[on music] I'm so eclectic and I use it in my work all the time. What I used a lot with Lee on _The Paperboy (2012)_ (qv) was 'Al Green' (qv).

I hold that dear to my heart.", "I remember having really mixed reactions to different films I brought to [Cannes Film Festival]. One of them was the Von Trier film, one of them was _To Die For (1995)_ (qv). It was actually an extraordinary reaction for _To Die For (1995)_ (qv). We were not in competition, and I remember being terribly scared that people were gonna hate it, but people loved it. That was very, very instrumentally beginning my career in terms of serious film-making. The critics got behind me on that film and that kind of took me from being 'Tom Cruise' (qv)'s wife into being something different, which artistically was such a joy for me.", "My ability to escape myself probably comes from the riskier the role. It took me a while to learn that and to understand that. I've tried to comfort and play the girl-next-door and the less complicated supporting roles.

And whether you love him or hate him, the filmmaking is incredibly strong.", "[on 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv) and working with him on _Eyes Wide Shut (1999)_ (qv)] Stanley wanted six months of rehearsal. He didn't want to start, and then he didn't want to finish. Stanley taught Tom [Cruise] and I, 'Never say no.' When someone proposes an idea, you never shut it down.

I don't take any of it for granted. I cherish it. I'm more than willing to make those sacrifices because, when I'm 70 and 80, I want my family around me. I know other things can come into play about that, but it's certainly not going to be because I didn't show up.", "I think love is the core emotion. Without that, and I've certainly existed without that, it's a very empty life. When I won the Oscar [for \"The Hours\"], I went home and I didn't have that in my life.

(2001)_ (qv) to the Cannes Film Festival and then all the way through to winning the Oscar for _The Hours (2002)_ (qv), that was a very strange time in my life because it was the collision of professional success and personal failure and that's just a very strange thing. When I won the Oscar it was kind of a mix of popping open a bottle of champagne but at the same time feeling incredibly lonely. It's been professional highs and personal lows and they collide. I'm hoping one day that \u00adwon't happen. Now is a good time personally but it's not a professional high. The highs are pretty extreme and they don't happen that often, do they? I much prefer the personal high anyway. I'd never give that up.", "I've turned things down, definitely. I was pregnant and I was going to do _The Reader (2008)_ (qv) and I had to call and say, 'I've spent my whole life wanting to be pregnant and I'm finally pregnant and I won't be able to do it.' And they were like, 'You could work pregnant.' No. That's not what I wanted to do. \"I didn't want to be working while I was pregnant. Some women could, maybe if they'd already had a lot of children, but for me it was such a huge place to be and I wanted to carry my baby and keep her healthy and peaceful.

You start out with big dreams and I mean, big dreams artistically. You want to work with the greatest living directors, make a great movie. I wanted to make a great love story, I wanted to make a great epic and then you realize that the truth of it is that it's so hard to make a great film. It's hard to get a great role. Those big expectations change to realism pretty quickly. But what's never changed is my desire to work with great directors and to find projects that push me out of my comfort zone and keep me alive. I still don't think I've done my best work", "[on her preparation for _Paddington (2014)_ (qv)] I'm about to go down to the museum and do a taxidermy class on Saturday night. And I love animals! I also have to throw knives, so I'll be doing that in the backyard. I've got a guy coming over to teach me how to throw a knife. I want to be able to just do it with a bit of a flourish. I believe this is my path, so I'll go down in fire if I have to.", "I think when you go into the orbit of a director, they bring certain things out in you. The greatest thing you can offer is abandonment, in terms of a performance, and also deep loyalty. Because when there is enormous loyalty to them, then it's a very safe place. It's like, O.K., so she'll stand by me no matter what, no matter if the film even succeeds or fails. We're in it together, and this is ours, together, forever. Which is why I probably stay very, very close to a lot of the directors that I've worked with, whether the outcome is successful or not. Because I get deeply sort of connected and close to them. Jane, Alejandro, Stephen, Lars - all of them. That's important to me, and the longevity of it.", "[on choosing 'Aaron Eckhart' (qv)]: I've known Aaron for a long time and he has a side of him which is very raw and emotional, which he doesn't show on screen very often.", "[on her villainous character in _The Golden Compass (2007)_ (qv)]: The beauty of this story is that it's a trilogy and I think that if we get to make the second and the third film - which I would love - you get to see all of the layers peel away from this woman. So that was what I was trying to do in this film, to give her the layers. There's a mystery there and you're not quite sure and you feel the texture of her.", "Snuggling is the secret to happiness.", "[on her West End stage play \"Photograph 51\"] It has made me fall in love with acting. The great thing about the play is I get to do it from beginning to end. Nothing ends up on the editing floor, it doesn't get changed. Once the actors step onto the stage, it's ours for 95 minutes and that's exquisite. Right now I'm having a love affair with being on stage.", "[on producing] It's allowed me to shape my career in terms of being able to find things that I may not get offered, that I wouldn't get the opportunity for. (February 2017).", "I'd really like to make some movie that penetrates the psyche of the world, deeply. I haven't done that for a long time because I tend to do smaller, more idiosyncratic films, which I love doing. I'm working with 'John Cameron Mitchell' (qv) again on _How to Talk to Girls at Parties (2017)_ (qv), and that's very idiosyncratic. Probably _Moulin Rouge! (2001)_ (qv) was the closest in the sense that I still meet people who saw it and when they talk to me they still call me Satine. So, yes, I have a lot of young gay men who come up to me and a lot of girls who come up me and I get many big hugs and they hold onto me and they say \"Oh, Satine. I love you, Satine.\" It's very sweet of them. (May 2016)", "[on her West End stage play \"Photograph 51\"] It was probably the most satisfying experience I've ever had. In my curtain call, tears would come down my face. Being on stage like that, it's incredibly direct.", "The truth of it is I love auteurs and I love philosophical filmmakers. That's why I love that _Big Little Lies (2017)_ (qv) got made. That's why I've gone back to a very subversive film with _The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017)_ (qv). I like the high-wire act of it. I believe in not towing the line. Conformity is what I run from. (February 2017).", "I've had extraordinary relationships with directors where my opinion is heard, loudly. And they were incredibly collaborative with me. But I believe in the hierarchy of the director. It's their art form and I'm only there to help them achieve it.", "The reason why I love Aquaman is 'James Wan' (qv) is an Australian, and I've followed his career since he started. He's a really good friend of mine, and he offered to let me play Queen Atlanna. As soon as he said I could wear mother-of-pearl and be a mermaid warrior, I said I'm done. Please. If there is one thing I have to do in my life, I have to be that. [Laughs] Because, you've got to have some fun.

It's an amazing reaction because I'm usually either in very avant-garde art films, or unusual films, or things that are very, very divisive. To be in something that is so accessible and still topical is very interesting to me. And to be in people's living rooms and be a part of their lives every week for a period of time, I like that. It's a very invigorating and stimulating place to be as an actor. (March 2017)", "I'm about to turn 50 in two weeks and I would never have thought this is gonna be one of the best years of my life. So many things have happened to me creatively. When I was about 40 I remember thinking \"Oh, at 50 I'll be retiring\". But no way.
