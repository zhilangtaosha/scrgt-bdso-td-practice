Since then, as a producer and as an actor-producer, he has shown an uncanny knack for choosing projects that reflect changing trends and public concerns. Over the years, he has been involved in such controversial and politically influential motion pictures as _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)_ (qv), _The China Syndrome (1979)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv), and such popular films as _Fatal Attraction (1987)_ (qv) and _Romancing the Stone (1984)_ (qv).'Michael Douglas' (qv) was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to actors 'Diana Douglas' (qv) (Diana Love Dill) and 'Kirk Douglas' (qv) (born Issur Danielovitch). His paternal grandparents were Belarusian Jewish immigrants, while his mother was born in Bermuda, the daughter of a local Attorney General, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Melville Dill; Diana's family had long been established in both Bermuda and the United States. Douglas's parents divorced when he was six, and he went to live with his mother and her new husband. Only seeing Kirk on holidays, Michael attended Eaglebrook school in Deerfield, Massachusetts, where he was about a year younger than all of his classmates.Douglas attended the elite preparatory Choate School and spent his summers with his father on movie sets. Although accepted at Yale, Douglas attended the University of California, Santa Barbara. Deciding he wanted to be an actor in his teenage years, Michael often asked his father about getting a \"foot in the door\". Kirk was strongly opposed to Michael pursuing an acting career, saying that it was an industry with many downs and few ups, and that he wanted all four of his sons to stay out of it. Michael, however, was persistent, and made his film debut in his father's film _Cast a Giant Shadow (1966)_ (qv).After receiving his B.A. degree in 1968, Douglas moved to New York City to continue his dramatic training, studying at the American Place Theatre with 'Wynn Handman' (qv), and at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where he appeared in workshop productions of Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author (1976) and 'Thornton Wilder' (qv)'s Happy Journey (1963). A few months after he arrived in New York, Douglas got his first big break, when he was cast in the pivotal role of the free-spirited scientist who compromises his liberal views to accept a lucrative job with a high-tech chemical corporation in the CBS Playhouse production of 'Ellen M. Violett' (qv)'s drama, The Experiment, which was televised nationwide on February 25, 1969.Douglas' convincing portrayal won him the leading role in the adaptation of John Weston's controversial novel, _Hail, Hero! (1969)_ (qv), which was the initial project of CBS's newly organized theatrical film production company, Cinema Center Films. Douglas starred as a well-meaning, almost saintly young pacifist determined not only to justify his beliefs to his conservative parents but also to test them under fire in the jungles of Indochina. His second feature, _Adam at Six A.M. (1970)_ (qv) concerned a young man's search for his roots. Douglas next appeared in the film version of 'Ron Cowen' (qv)'s play _Summertree (1971)_ (qv), produced by ''Kirk Douglas' (qv)'' Bryna Company, and then _Napoleon and Samantha (1972)_ (qv), a sentimental children's melodrama from the Walt Disney studio.In between film assignments, he worked in summer stock and off-Broadway productions, among them \"City Scenes\", 'Frank Gagliano' (qv)'s surrealistic vignettes of contemporary life in New York, 'John Patrick Shanley' (qv)'s short-lived romance \"Love is a Time of Day\" and 'George Tabori' (qv)'s \"Pinkville\", in which he played a young innocent brutalized by his military training. He also appeared in the made-for-television thriller, \"When Michael Calls\", broadcast by ABC-TV on February 5, 1972 and in episodes of the popular series \"Medical Center\" and \"The FBI\".Impressed by Douglas' performance in a segment of The F.B.I. (1965), producer 'Quinn Martin' signed the actor for the part of 'Karl Malden' (qv)'s sidekick in the police series \"The Streets of San Francisco\", which premiered September of 1972 and became one of ABC's highest-rated prime-time programs in the mid-1970s. Douglas earned three successive Emmy Award nominations for his performance and he directed two episodes of the series.During the annual breaks in the shooting schedule for The Streets of _San Francisco (1972)_, Douglas devoted most of his time to his film production company, Big Stick Productions, Ltd., which produced several short subjects in the early 1970s. Long interested in producing a film version of 'Ken Kesey' (qv)'s grimly humorous novel _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)_ (qv), Douglas purchased the movie rights from his father and began looking for financial backing. After a number of major motion picture studios turned him down, Douglas formed a partnership with 'Saul Zaentz' (qv), a record industry executive, and the two set about recruiting the cast and crew. Douglas still had a year to go on his contract for \"The Streets of San Francisco\", but the producers agreed to write his character out of the story so that he could concentrate on filming \"Cuckoo's Nest\".A critical and commercial success, _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)_ (qv) won five Academy 'Awards' (qv), including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Actress, and went on to gross more than $180 million at the box office. Douglas suddenly found himself in demand as an independent producer. One of the many scripts submitted to him for consideration was Mike Gray's chilling account of the attempted cover-up of an accident at a nuclear power plant. Attracted by the combination of social relevance and suspense, Douglas immediately bought the property. Deemed not commercial by most investors, Douglas teamed up with 'Jane Fonda' (qv) and her own motion picture production company, IPC Films.A 'Michael Douglas' (qv)-IPC Films co-production, _The China Syndrome (1979)_ (qv) starred 'Jack Lemmon' (qv), 'Jane Fonda' (qv), and ''Michael Douglas' (qv)' and received Academy Award nominations for Lemmon and Fonda, as well as for Best Screenplay. The National Board of Review named the film one of the best films of the year.Despite his success as a producer, Douglas resumed his acting career in the late 1970s, starring in Michael Crichton's medical thriller _Coma (1978)_ (qv) with Genevieve Bujold, Claudia Weill's feminist comedy _It's My Turn (1980)_ (qv) starring 'Jill Clayburgh' (qv), and 'Peter Hyams' (qv)' gripping tale of modern-day vigilante justice, \"The Star Chamber\" (1983). Douglas also starred in _Running (1979)_ (qv), as a compulsive quitter who sacrifices everything to take one last shot at the Olympics, and as Zach the dictatorial director/choreographer in 'Richard Attenborough' (qv)'s screen version of the Broadway's longest running musical _A Chorus Line (1985)_ (qv).Douglas' career as an actor/producer came together again in 1984 with the release of the tongue-in-cheek romantic fantasy \"Romancing the Stone\". Douglas had begun developing the project several years earlier, and with Kathleen Turner as Joan Wilder, the dowdy writer of gothic romances, 'Danny DeVito' (qv) as the feisty comic foil Ralphie and Douglas as Jack Colton, the reluctant soldier of fortune, \"Romancing\" was a resounding hit and grossed more than $100 million at the box office. Douglas was named Producer of the Year in 1984 by the National Association of Theater Owners. Douglas, Turner and DeVito reteamed in 1985 for the successful sequel _The Jewel of the Nile (1985)_ (qv).It took Douglas nearly two years to convince Columbia Pictures executives to approve the production of _Starman (1984)_ (qv), an unlikely tale of romance between an extraterrestrial, played by 'Jeff Bridges', and a young widow, played by Karen Allen. _Starman (1984)_ (qv) was the sleeper hit of the 1984 Christmas season and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for 'Jeff Bridges'. In 1986 Douglas created a television series based on the film for ABC which starred 'Robert Hays'.After a lengthy break from acting, Douglas returned to the screen in 1987 appearing in two of the year's biggest hits.

I'm so impressed by her intelligence, sense of humor and work ethic.", "Times have changed and sex sells. Around 1990 I voluntarily went into rehab because I was drinking too much and some smart-ass editor said, \"Oh, another boring story about an actor going to rehab. Let's give him sex addiction.\" Then it became, \"Self-confessed sex addict!\".", "My life does take a bit of work. I certainly know how much guys like Catherine ['Catherine Zeta-Jones' (qv)], and well deserved. She's fantastic and beautiful inside and out, she's a talented, talented actress, really good mom and a heck of a wife.", "I was there the night 'John Lennon' (qv) was shot, three blocks away. It left a lasting impression on me. It motivated me to do whatever I could to lobby for small-arms control.", "I admire 'Albert Finney' (qv) very much, his performances always look so effortless. And of course, my good friend 'Jack Nicholson' (qv), who lives life to the full, and who never ever does things by halves. He's a real hero!", "When you are a second-generation success, you are provided for. And that certainly was a big opportunity. But you don't have that \"rags-to-riches\" story, which is always a much more dramatic story to plot. Your success is not one that is as easily accepted by the people outside. Or they don't really have an appreciation of what you have accomplished. As a producer, my successes came fairly early in my career; as an actor, they came much later. Winning the Academy Award for _Wall Street (1987)_ (qv) really helped me to finally overcome that \"second generation\" thing. It's hard for people, no matter how generous and gracious they are, to really allow you any slack. They say, \"Oh, it must have been hard to be 'Kirk Douglas' (qv)' son\", but they don't really want to accept it. You grow up in this business and all that means is that you don't get the joy of succeeding. If you succeed, it's expected. If you look around you can see that there are hardly any second-generation people that have succeeded at all. It's a minefield of disasters, of broken careers and self-destruction out there. The public's perception is that you didn't have to do anything. So if you succeed, it's just assumed. If you don't get success, you're an asshole like everybody else.", "[1998] I create challenges by the roles I take. I'm sort of proud of the fact that I'm not really typecast. People are always trying to get a handle on what you do. With me, either it's my sex trilogy: _Fatal Attraction (1987)_ (qv), _Basic Instinct (1992)_ (qv) and _Disclosure (1994)_ (qv)--or my businessman trilogy: _Wall Street (1987)_ (qv), _The Game (1997)_ (qv) and this picture I'm doing now called _A Perfect Murder (1998)_ (qv). I've been fortunate that, within those categories, I've been able to choose different types of roles, and I am proud that the audience has been able to accept me in whatever type of role I play. They are not the typical \"movie star\" roles. They're more ambivalent characters. Sometimes they are morally depraved. They are not the outright positive type of images that you attribute to selecting a \"star\"-type role. And the pictures themselves are more oddball. I've been very fortunate in that area, too. I've taken chances and so far the audiences have basically condoned those choices. They have allowed me to do those different types of roles. I do pictures for myself, because I figure if I like them, some other crazy people out there might like them, too. You know, once you've gained your confidence and done some bizarre, strange films with some roles that have been successful, it gives you the confidence to go out there and take more chances.", "Actors are paid to be selfish and self-involved.", "Those British film certificates explained in full: \"Oh, I get it, it's simple. PG means the hero gets the girl, 15 means that the villain gets the girl, and 18 means everybody gets the girl.\".", "[on his career and his favorite films] I always say you work as hard on your failures as your successes. I like my track record, I like my batting average. I got a real good batting average. A lot of movies. Not a lot of grand-slam home-runs, lot of singles, doubles, triples. Lot of hits, you know? Small but kind of ultimately worked out. Kind of fiduciary responsibilities and budgets. The ones that stick out are the ones nobody wanted to make, from _Falling Down (1993)_ (qv) to _Fatal Attraction (1987)_ (qv), things like that. Or ones that were so bizarre. _The War of the Roses (1989)_ (qv), _Wonder Boys (2000)_ (qv).", "[on if he enjoys working on indie films] It's challenging, and as I say, it makes you go back to being much more instinctual and not overly planning or overly preparing. You do your homework before and just go, but it's really sort of where the pictures lie that you just wanna do. You try to mix it up, anyway. You always try to get a commercial picture or so-called \"commercial\" film in there from time to time, mixed up with an independent or a smaller or a character piece. So yeah, I'm pretty flexible. I enjoy it, I really do. It's something I like and am passionate about.", "[on researching his characters] With _Black Rain (1989)_ (qv) I spent a lot of time with homicide detectives, and I spent a lot of time with different brokers on _Wall Street (1987)_ (qv). It helps get the rhythm of the piece and the tone, and how overplayed or underplayed it might be. That's also the magic of movies: You get to hang out and live these different lives. I think a certain amount of that helps the verisimilitude.", "_King of California (2007)_ (qv) was just, I thought, a really great, fresh, original kind of script. I loved the tone, the mix of tragedy, comedy and drama, and that it was a good part. Kind of a challenge, and I was excited to work on it.", "[on _Basic Instinct 2 (2006)_ (qv)] Yes, they asked me to do it a while ago, I thought we had done it very effectively. 'Paul Verhoeven' (qv) is a pretty good director. I haven't seen the sequel. I've only done one sequel in my life, _The Jewel of the Nile (1985)_ (qv), from _Romancing the Stone (1984)_ (qv). Besides, there were age issues, you know? ['Sharon Stone' (qv)] still looks fabulous. The script was pretty good. Good for her, she's in her late 40s and there are not a lot of parts around. The first one was probably the best picture of her career--it certainly made her career and she was great in it.", "It's hard in my business to find new friends because you're always suspect of what their motives might be. And while I don't like that about myself, I tend to get a little more cautious about making new friends. The people that you knew either when you were starting out in your career or in college didn't take your success as part of the equation of your friendship. They are the ones you love and trust. I would like to be more open about meeting people, but it's hard.", "I do most of my preparation before the filming process starts. Your principal choices are done beforehand and then if you feel like you've nailed it, and you have adequate time, then you get to try something else. One of the biggest lessons I have learned as an actor is that it's all just celluloid, it's all disposable. They only use a little bit and you try to remind yourself of that so that you can take chances and burn film if you've got to. Make a fool of yourself. Do something that's not right. And that's the biggest risk and opportunity.", "Unlike your average profession, acting usually comes in concentrated doses. When you're an actor, it's anywhere from two and a half to five months of intense work and then it's done. That's the hardest part of film acting. There is no audience response, so you really don't get any immediate satisfaction. What I really love is the feeling of nailing something. You nail the scene. Most of the time you don't shoot movies in continuity, you only do things in parts, so nailing a scene is really a rewarding sensation.", "The process of making a movie continues to amaze me. There is a certain magic that happens. And you never know when it's going to be. But while a writer is alone with their word processor, or a painter is alone in a studio, or a musician is working on a song, movie making is a big kind of collaborative family. Certainly it starts with the written word, but then it becomes a collaborative art and that process never ceases to amaze me. It's almost mystical. It's something that is really alive and fresh.", "I do pictures for myself, because I figure if I like them, some other crazy people out there might like them, too. You know, once you've gained your confidence and done some bizarre, strange films with some roles that have been successful, it gives you the confidence to go out there and take more chances.", "[on the death of 'Karl Malden' (qv) in 2009] It was Karl who, more than anyone, got me to understand that an actor is just one part of a whole team that makes a television series or movie work. And thanks to him, I learned about the dichotomy of standing alone in a craft where one must collaborate.", "[on his decision to give the lead role in _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)_ (qv) to 'Jack Nicholson' (qv) instead of his father 'Kirk Douglas' (qv)] My father has played up his disappointment with that pretty good. God bless him, he's 93. I finally said, \"Dad, I worked six years getting this together . . . \" I have to remind him, I shared part of my producing back-end [credit] with him, so he ended up making more money off that movie than he had in any other picture.", "[on the sequel _Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010)_ (qv)] There was a recession when the first movie arrived in 1987. There's a recession now. Greed, which Gordon Gekko declared as being good, hasn't just survived but has thrived amid easy credit, sub-prime mortgages and an America that ignored the signs of an oncoming market collapse. We brought 'Oliver Stone' (qv) a script. Stone, the son of a stockbroker, wanted to do it.", "[on 'Karl Malden' (qv)] He was fantastic. He just had a tremendous discipline, tremendous ethics. He insisted that next's week's script would be there when we were shooting that week's script. Every time between setups, between breaks, we'd go in the trailer and run lines for the next's week's show. That's the kind of discipline, training I got from Karl.", "Not going public with having cancer was not much of an option, even if I had objected. When you are a celebrity, nothing remains secret for very long. If it helps bring attention, then that is a major upside to this whole thing. Millions of families are going through the same thing my family and I are now going through. If I can bring any relief or encouragement to those suffering, that's the good news.", "[on his on- and off-screen chemistry with 'Karl Malden' (qv), who played Lt. Mike Stone on _The Streets of San Francisco (1972)_ (qv)] I've had mentors. 'Karl Malden' (qv) was clearly a mentor and one of the most important people in my professional career. He was a tremendous influence on me in so many areas--such as work ethic. But I think that's probably why I do all these grey characters, I don't see a lot of heroes around.", "[on dropping out of _Cutthroat Island (1995)_ (qv)] I was fairly far down the road with that film, but I didn't pull out right before production--it was four or five months before. I just didn't feel comfortable doing a picture with the director married to the leading lady. After a couple of drafts, I didn't like where it was going. There was all this momentum to go ahead, but it didn't smell good.", "[2001, on wrapping _Falling Down (1993)_ (qv) the same day the 'Rodney King' (qv) riots began] You know, as we finished that film the riots were going on in L.A. I'll never forget the last day of shooting--that's literally when it all started. We were working in the Valley [L.A.'s San Fernando Valley] and, when we finished, I headed to the airport. It was a war zone. You could see dots of fires all over the place, all heading for the west side of town. I got my family on a plane--I didn't even know where it was going.", "[2001, on why he thinks _Black Rain (1989)_ (qv) didn't do better at the box office] It was hard to know who to root for. And people here were uncomfortable with race stuff and talking about the bomb. There was a critic, who'll remain nameless, who called it a racist film. I called him up and asked, \"Have you ever been to Japan?\". He said, \"No\", and I said, \"Then what the hell are you talking about?\". The Japanese loved it. I loved it--I thought it rocked from top to bottom.", "[2001, on his sex scene with 'Jeanne Tripplehorn' (qv) in _Basic Instinct (1992)_ (qv)] In a scene like that, what I try always to do is make the actress feel comfortable, let her know that I will be looking out for her. Okay, I'm going to touch your breast here. So there's none of that where she feels, \"Hey, what are you doing?\" It's sort of like doing fight sequences. You go through the beats. I'm going to go boom, kiss, kiss, rip. Then it's action and you do it. It's the most unspontaneous thing in the world. The difficulty of doing a sex scene is that sex is the one thing in movies that your entire audience knows about. Nobody in the audience has been killed and most haven't taken a bullet or been in any brutal fights. Lovemaking, everybody's an expert.", "[2001, on why he and 'Catherine Zeta-Jones' (qv) sold photos of their newborn baby] It seems odd, I guess, for the United States. But Catherine [wife 'Catherine Zeta-Jones' (qv)] is an international star and, in England, the paparazzi become like bounty hunters and go to extraordinary extremes to take a photograph they can sell. When you spend your whole life protecting your name and likeness, how do you deal with these people? I've been really open about it, saying, \"Look, you want to take a photograph of me and sell it? We'll split the money, and I'll give my half to charity.\" When we were going to have a baby, we knew a bounty hunt would happen. So when we were contacted by a magazine about their doing a layout, paying us for it, then syndicating the photos--a fairly common practice in Europe as opposed to here--we simply saw it as a way to build financial security for our new son and control what was going to be a madhouse. I'd rather do that than have some guy harassing us, though that happens anyway.", "Catherine [wife 'Catherine Zeta-Jones' (qv)] was a tremendous surprise in my life. After my divorce, I was puttering along quite well as a single guy and couldn't believe how honest you could be with ladies, as long as you didn't date two of them in the same town at the same time. They knew I was seeing other people. Then I got struck down, I was just bowled over by Catherine, I was smitten with her. The age difference has been irrelevant to us.", "Kirk's [father 'Kirk Douglas' (qv)] career was constant, overwhelming. The guy didn't stop. Back then, they were doing five movies a year. My father did 90-plus films. He was _Spartacus (1960)_ (qv)! I always admired his tenacity and stamina but he was intimidating to me as a child. Like a lot of actors, he was consumed with ambition and his career. He was also consumed with guilt because of the time he spent away from the family. It took him a long time to come to terms with it. But we get on very well now.", "[on the 2008 financial crash] I lost 35-40% of my net worth. I decided to just weather out the storm. I waited, didn't do anything and the next year we kind of came back to where we were the year before, but I lost two years. Now I manage my own funds. I am much more conservative these days in my investments.", "I was always shocked when so many people who saw _Wall Street (1987)_ (qv) said I was the person who influenced them and inspired them to go into investment banking. I'd say, \"I was the villain,\" and they would say, \"No, no, no.\" They didn't see me that way, so it was all very seductive I guess.", "[ruling out a post-series _The Streets of San Francisco (1972)_ (qv) reunion movie] Like any great thing, like a fine wine, it's better off left alone.", "[on watching 'Liberace' (qv) on television] I never thought about the gayness. He just looked like he was having so much fun. And that whole idea of talking directly to the audience, you just went along with him. He made you happy.", "[on more films centering on seniors] Well, they're back in the theaters. We've done this full circle when movies were designed for kids, but now they all watch them on their iPads. The old folks want to get out of the house.", "[on _Behind the Candelabra (2013)_ (qv)] I just want to commend Matt because I don't think I would have had the courage at that point in my career to take this on.", "[on _Behind the Candelabra (2013)_ (qv)] I think the studios, in their infinite wisdom, even with Matt ['Matt Damon' (qv)], myself and ['Steven Soderbergh' (qv)] attached, thought it would only attract a gay audience. And with the cost of marketing movies and making them, they didn't want to take that risk. I see it as the studios' loss.", "It's a much smaller minority of people who think they still have to stay in the closet. It's quite interesting to see how fast it's all changed. Without naming names, I certainly think there are a couple of people out there who have not come out in the spirit of protecting their careers and livelihoods. It's probably a little bit more difficult going that way. I think that's true.", "[on 'Saul Zaentz' (qv)] Saul is a wonderful mixture--he's a street-smart guy from Jersey who has impeccable taste. There are a lot of people in this town who pretend to have both toughness and good taste, but with Saul it isn't pretense. His power comes from his joy and enthusiasm for a project.", ". . . in your career you can count on one hand the really good part. In _Wall Street (1987)_ (qv), I had the best part I ever had.", "I am not selfish enough to slow down. I hurt myself because I'm such a team player. I'm great to work with; I'm always looking out for other actor and making it work.", "A lot of directors aren't really keen on working with an actor who's also a producer. As if they're talking to you, and they feel like your wheels are going in the back of your head.", "One of the things I'm most proud about in _Fatal Attraction (1987)_ (qv) is you start off with an audience not liking you.", "There's something going on with young American actors--both men and women--because the Brits and Australians are taking many of the best American roles from them. Clearly, it breaks down on two fronts. In Britain, they take their training seriously, while in the States, we're going through a sort of social media image-conscious thing rather than formal training. Many actors are getting caught up in this image thing which is going on to affect their range. With the Aussies, particularly with the males, it's the masculinity. In the United States, we have this relatively asexual or unisex area with sensitive young men and we don't have many Channing Tatums or Chris Pratts, while the Aussies do. It's a phenomena. There's a crisis in young American actors right now. Everyone is much more image-conscious than they are about actually playing the part.", "[on his bout with cancer] It's been five years and I feel really good. But you have a new appreciation.
