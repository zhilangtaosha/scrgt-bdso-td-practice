DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom _Growing Pains (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as 'Martin Scorsese' (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan' (qv).Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, the only child of 'Irmelin DiCaprio' (qv) (n\u00e9e Indenbirken) and former comic book artist 'George DiCaprio' (qv). His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as _Roseanne (1988)_ (qv) and _The New Lassie (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie. While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _Growing Pains (1985)_ (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on _Growing Pains (1985)_ (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in _What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late 'River Phoenix' (qv) originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as Romeo Montague in 'Baz Luhrmann' (qv)'s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The Man in the Iron Mask (1998)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000)_ (qv) being some of his few notable roles during this period.In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director 'Martin Scorsese' (qv). With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan' (qv)'s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any clich\u00e9 about actors.In 2012, he played a mustache-twirling villain in _Django Unchained (2012)_ (qv), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in _The Great Gatsby (2013)_ (qv) and 'Jordan Belfort' (qv) in _The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)_ (qv).DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.::Pedro Borges"], "trade mark": ["Often appears in the films of 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)", "Often plays conflicted, tortured-by-their-own-demons characters, who need to deal with their past", "Often plays hard-edged anti-heroes", "Intense emotional acting style", "Often stars in period films or plays real-life individuals", "Frequently plays men who have suffered a loss or trauma", "Often plays characters who are ill-fated (e.g. The Quick and the Dead, Romeo + Juliet, Titanic, The Departed, The Great Gatsby etc.)", "Often plays troubled or twisted tycoons (The Aviator, The Great Gatsby, Django Unchained and The Wolf of Wall Street)", "Only uses his media presence for environmental or human rights causes."], "trivia": ["(April 16, 1999) While filming _The Beach (2000)_ (qv) off the coast of Thailand, Leonardo and others were swept off a camera boat by strong winds and waves.

No, I have a production company that all stemmed from 10 years ago wanting to be able to develop my own material because I just wasn't finding things I got excited about.

I sometimes go on a vacation, too. I take what I do very seriously, and when I'm on the set that's all I focus on, so my vice is to hang out with my friends and talk about absolutely nothing of importance whatsoever and act like a complete idiot because I've got to filter out a lot of the serious stuff I'm dealing with all the time.

He wrote the entire thing, and it all made sense to him. It didn't make much sense to us when we were doing it, and we had to do a ton of detective work to try to figure out what the movie was and what we were doing from day to day, but, thank God, we had somebody who knew what he was doing.", "(2010) These last couple of films have taken a lot out of me so I don't know what I'm going to do next. I have no idea and it's kind of a cool place to be. This year is going to be the year of really taking care of myself because I've reached 35 and I've taken a lot of things seriously, maybe too seriously at times, so I'm going to make sure that whatever I do next and whatever choices I make are really right for me. And we'll see where that takes me.", "[on filming in Mozambique for _Blood Diamond (2006)_ (qv)] Forget weather-wise. Condition-wise, there are a lot of hardships for the people that live in Mozambique, and there's a lot of situations going on with poverty and AIDS and unsanitary water. You name it. But the most intriguing thing I found about shooting in Mozambique was the triumph and adaptability of the human spirit: People were still filled with so much joy. They were literally dancing in the streets every night. It was an amazing thing to see.", "(2010) I want to be an actor just like my role models, 'Robert De Niro' (qv), for example. Being discreet in his private life has allowed him to be even more credible in different roles on the big screen.", "[on his post-_Titanic (1997)_ (qv) romantic life] - I had better success meeting girls before _Titanic (1997)_ (qv). My interactions with them didn't have all the stigma behind it, not to mention there wasn't a perception of her talking to me for only one reason.", "[on how he dealt with post-_Titanic (1997)_ (qv) youth] I got to be wild and nuts, and I didn't suffer as much as people do now, where they have to play it so safe that they ruin their credibility. I didn't care what anyone thought.It was also about avoiding the tornado of chaos, of potential downfall. My two main competitors in the beginning, the blond-haired kids I went to audition with, one hung himself and the other died of a heroin overdose... I was never into drugs at all. There aren't stories of me in a pool of my own vomit in a hotel room on the Hollywood Strip.", "During Gilbert Grape [_What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv)] I didn't know where I was gonna go as an actor so I didn't know what types of movies I wanted to do. I just felt like doing a movie is doing a movie. I get money and fame, and that's great, and I can act and have fun. And I was up for a movie called _Hocus Pocus (1993)_ (qv) with 'Bette Midler' (qv), and I knew it was awful, but it was just like, \"Okay, they're offering me more and more money. Isn't that what you do? You do movies and you get more and more money.\" But something inside of me kept saying, \"Don't do this movie.\" And everyone around me was saying, \"Leonardo, how could you not take a movie?\" And I said to myself, \"Okay, I'll audition for this movie Gilbert Grape. If I don't get that, I'll do Hocus Pocus.\" I found myself trying so hard, investing so much time and energy in Gilbert Grape, I worked so damn hard at it and I finally got it, and it was like such a weight off my shoulders.", "(On landing _This Boy's Life (1993)_ (qv)) When I was fifteen, I got this amazing opportunity to audition for this plum role opposite 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Ellen Barkin' (qv) in This Boy's Life. Before that, it was The New Lassie or a Bubble Yum commercial. They were using the mustard-jar scene in the audition. De Niro was going up to the kids with this almost empty mustard jar and cramming it into their faces, really pushing the kids' buttons. The scene was being used to see if the kid could stand up to De Niro, and it was hard not to be overwhelmed. When he started bludgeoning me, I completely overcompensated. He said, \"Is this empty? Is this empty?\" I slapped the jar out of his hand, got right up in his face, and screamed at the top of my lungs, \"Noooooooo!\" It was the most god-awful way to do the scene. I was supposed to be the victim, not the antagonizer, and there was complete silence. De Niro looks at me and goes, \"Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh\", in that way only De Niro can laugh. \"That was good. That was goooood. I like that. A little over-the-top but good\". My audition was supposed to go on, but they just stopped it. Even though De Niro said he liked it, I left the room thinking, Oh, shit, I'm a laughingstock. I'm buried. I'm done. Getting that part felt like winning the lottery. Sometimes you've got to go to the wrong place just to show that you're not afraid to go there.", "(2010) Probably the only thing I knew with complete clarity was that I wanted to be an actor. But there was a lot of rejection early on, and so it never felt like, Hey, I've got something here. There was always an element of me that needed to prove something to myself. It's something I don't want to get rid of, because it's what drives me. I'm never settled and I'm never satisfied.", "(2010) I was the most insane child you can imagine, pretty intolerable to be around. High-octane energy all the time, never wanting to focus on schoolwork.", "[on playing Jack Dawson in _Titanic (1997)_ (qv)] I'm not haunted by it but it certainly follows me. I've been to the Amazon and people with no clothes on - and I'm not exaggerating - know about that film. I've accepted it.", "When I can't immediately define the character and there's an element of mystery to it and still a lot to be explored, that's when I say yes. I like those kinds of complicated characters.", "There are a lot of pitfalls to success, and one is not listening to criticism. One of the the most important things you can do is hear criticism of yourself and embrace it, whether it be - in my case - artistic or personal.", "[on what drew him to portraying Jay Gatsby] The idea of a man who came from absolutely nothing, who created himself solely from his own imagination. Gatsby's one of those iconic characters because he can be interpreted in so many ways: a hopeless romantic, a completely obsessed wacko or a dangerous gangster, clinging to wealth.", "[on playing the plantation owner in _Django Unchained (2012)_ (qv)] There was absolutely nothing about this man that I could identify with. I hated him. It was one of the most narcissistic, self-indulgent, racist, horrible characters I've ever read in my entire life.", "You learn, after you've been in the business for a while, that fame is empty and pointless.", "[on _Charlie Rose (1991)_ (qv)] There's going to be a wider gap between the independent genre filmmaking and the big budget, sort of spectacle movies. And the movies that are a hybrid of those two things - that have deep content in them and that also have some scope - will kind of dissolve away. I see that happening more and more in the industry, it's either like: \"This is a regurgitation of films you've seen a thousand times that work... Or you can take a chance and do a really low budget, small movie and see how it turns out.\".", "[on _The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)_ (qv)] I think it's amazing somebody like 'Martin Scorsese' (qv) is still making films that are vital and talked about, and have an element of controversy about them and are appealing to people of my generation. We grew up watching his films and he's still making stuff that's punk rock. It's an amazing achievement.", "[on working with 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)] I grew up a fan of the Golden Age of cinema which, to me and all of my friends, was the '70s and the great age of films where the director had control. We got to see some of the most memorable films and performances of all time during that era and everything since then has always been a reversion and comparison back to those films. Any one of my friends, whenever we talk about movies, we always reference something from the '70s. And to me, the greatest cinematic partnership maybe of all time, and certainly of that time period, was De Niro and Scorsese. In a lot of ways, they were a part of my upbringing and my childhood, as far as being a fan of cinema. So to get to work with him, being of completely different generations -- we just have a shared understanding that we're out there to do the same thing. I think that's taken a while to truly understand on his part -- not a while but, I mean, it's been a culmination of more and more trust with one another. And, in a lot of ways, I think [_The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)_ (qv)] is the result of being able to work with each other on our films before it. We were not going to try to do something in a traditional sense in this film. We'd been given the opportunity to make a film that was going to hopefully be outrageous and daring and push the envelope a little bit. So it wasn't necessarily a dialogue about what type of movie we wanted to do after the experiences that we've had together. At this point, it was just about us reminding one another, with very specific character decisions or plot points. But, just to backtrack a little, I understand his mentality, too. You have to understand: This man is the greatest admirer of cinema as an art form of anyone you'll ever meet, and there's nothing in his life that he doesn't reference cinema to. He lives and breathes this. He's got such an admiration and appreciation for what's been done in the past. And he's got that hunger in him, as well, and that excitement for us to just be able to do the type of films that we want to do. The fact that, through the years now, we've trusted one another to know that we're not doing anything for our own self-interest -- it's more about making the best, most original movie we can -- has been an incredible experience for me. And I don't stop learning. I mean, every time I'm on set with him I learn more about the reason I make movies and the reason I'm an actor than anything I've ever done.", "[on getting awards attention for _The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)_ (qv)] Of course it would be meaningful. I think everyone wants to be recognized by their peers, absolutely, without question. But, the truth of the matter is you learn very quickly you have absolutely no control of what critics or audiences are going to think. You really just have to do everything you can to make the best film. That's the one thing that I do know. But, of course, you know, I would love for this film on all fronts to get some attention because there's only been two films in my entire career that I've really developed myself, really championed to get financed and got a director involved with, and that's been _The Aviator (2004)_ (qv) and this. And so, in a lot of ways -- and I hate to use the term -- those two are my \"babies.\" Those were the films that I really did everything I possibly could to get made in the right way. And I think that they're very difficult movies to pull off, especially with this one, a film that opens yourself and the movie up to a lot of criticism. So to get any kind of recognition would be amazing for this, absolutely.", "[on 'Jordan Belfort' (qv), the character he plays in _The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)_ (qv)] He was like a modern-day emperor Caligula. He held nothing back and was unapologetic about his lust for wealth and mad consumption.", "[on his childhood] There was a major prostitution ring on my street corner, crime and violence everywhere. It really was like _Taxi Driver (1976)_ (qv) in a lot of ways. I grew up very poor and I got to see the other side of the spectrum. I've never done drugs. That's because I saw this stuff literally every day when I was three or four years old. So Hollywood was a walk in the park for me. I'd go to parties and it was there, and yeah, there's that temptation.", "[on why he doesn't want to direct films] I've been so blessed to work with some great filmmakers, that I'm probably cursed to probably ever work as a director myself. I don't think I would be able to compare to what I've seen. There are so many things that come into play when you make a movie. I really don't know how they do it. The truth is, the one thing I regret, if anything, in my long career having worked with the likes of Alejandro ['Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu' (qv)] and Marty ['Martin Scorsese' (qv)] is not be able to be a voyeur and stand aside and watch what they do, because I'm only concerned about what the hell I'm doing every single day. (...) But it would have been wonderful to have someone document all the great experiences I had and learn from the decisions. That's what you have to look for when you work with these directors. It's these tiny little decisions that change something from being mundane.

Thank you to the Academy, thank you to all of you in this room. I have to congratulate the other incredible nominees this year for their unbelievable performances.

First off, to my brother in this endeavor, Mr. 'Tom Hardy' (qv) Tom, your fierce talent on screen can only be surpassed by your friendship off screen. To Mr. Alejandro Innaritu, as the history of cinema unfolds, you have forged your way into history these past 2 years... thank you for creating a transcendent cinematic experience. Thank you to everybody at Fox and New Regency...my entire team. I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career...to Mr. Jones for casting me in my first film to Mr. Scorsese for teaching me so much about the cinematic art form. To my parents, none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends, I love you dearly, you know who you are. And lastly I just want to say this: Making The Revenant was about man's relationship to the natural world. A world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people out there who would be most affected by this. For our children's children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed. I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much.", "(2016) I've been very lucky to have achieved a lot of the things that I dreamed of achieving as a young man. But, at the end of the day - and I truly believe this - it is not about achieving great wealth or success. Because they don't bring happiness ultimately. They really don't.

As soon as my name alone was enough to make this happen, I vowed to myself that I was going to work with directors who were changing cinema, doing something important, you know?
