His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother's heritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German. The young Stallone attended the American College of Switzerland and the University of Miami, eventually obtaining a B.A. degree. Initially, he struggled in small parts in films such as the soft-core _The Party at Kitty and Stud's (1970)_ (qv), the thriller _Klute (1971)_ (qv) and the comedy _Bananas (1971)_ (qv). He got a crucial career break alongside fellow young actor 'Henry Winkler' (qv), sharing lead billing in the effectively written teen gang film _The Lords of Flatbush (1974)_ (qv). Further film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring productions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac, bloodthirsty race driver named \"Machine Gun Joe Viterbo\" in the 'Roger Corman' (qv)-produced _Death Race 2000 (1975)_ (qv). However, Stallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an actor, and, inspired by the 1975 'Muhammad Ali' (qv)-'Chuck Wepner' (qv) fight in Cleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given the \"million to one opportunity\" to challenge for the heavyweight title. _Rocky (1976)_ (qv) became the stuff of cinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially successful movie franchises in history! Whilst full credit is wholly deserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from fellow cast members 'Talia Shire' (qv), 'Burgess Meredith' (qv) and 'Burt Young' (qv), and director 'John G. Avildsen' (qv) gave the film an emotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived on his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure Hollywood's hottest new star.Stallone followed _Rocky (1976)_ (qv) with _F.I.S.T. (1978)_ (qv), loosely based on the life of Teamsters boss \"Jimmy Hoffa\", and _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv) before pulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the sequel _Rocky II (1979)_ (qv). The second outing for the \"Italian Stallion\" wasn't as powerful or successful as the first \"Rocky\"; however, it still produced strong box office. Subsequent films _Nighthawks (1981)_ (qv) and _Victory (1981)_ (qv) failed to ignite with audiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory with _Rocky III (1982)_ (qv) and a fearsome opponent in \"Clubber Lang\" played by muscular ex-bodyguard 'Mr. T' (qv). The third \"Rocky\" installment far outperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone retired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another mega-franchise was about to commence for the busy actor.The character of Green Beret \"John Rambo\" was the creation of Canadian-born writer 'David Morrell' (qv), and his novel was adapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in _First Blood (1982)_ (qv), also starring 'Richard Crenna' (qv) and 'Brian Dennehy' (qv). The movie was a surprise hit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the Vietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public's psyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and a sequel soon followed with _Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985)_ (qv), which drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the film's plotline about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam. But they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and \"John Rambo's\" second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and cemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave of amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky Balboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a Soviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named \"Ivan Drago\" played by curt 'Dolph Lundgren' (qv) in _Rocky IV (1985)_ (qv). The fourth outing was somewhat controversial with \"Rocky\" fans, as violence levels seemed excessive compared to previous \"Rocky\" films, especially with the savage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by 'Carl Weathers' (qv), at the hands of the unstoppable \"Siberian Express\".Stallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films that met with a mixed reception from his fans. _Cobra (1986)_ (qv) was a clumsy mess, _Over the Top (1987)_ (qv) was equally mediocre, _Rambo III (1988)_ (qv) saw Rambo take on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film _Tango & Cash (1989)_ (qv) just did not quite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there was chemistry between Stallone and co-star 'Kurt Russell' (qv).Philadelphia's favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his fifth screen outing in _Rocky V (1990)_ (qv) tackling Tommy \"Machine\" Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter 'Tommy Morrison' (qv), the great-nephew of screen legend 'John Wayne' (qv). Sly quickly followed with the lukewarm comedy _Oscar (1991)_ (qv), the painfully unfunny _Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992)_ (qv), the futuristic action film _Demolition Man (1993)_ (qv), and the comic book-inspired _Judge Dredd (1995)_ (qv). Interestingly, Stallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he had been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more dramatically challenging role in the intriguing _Cop Land (1997)_ (qv), also starring 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Ray Liotta' (qv). It isn't a classic of the genre, but _Cop Land (1997)_ (qv) certainly surprised many critics with Stallone's understated performance. Stallone then lent his vocal talents to the animated adventure story _Antz (1998)_ (qv), reprised the role made famous by 'Michael Caine' (qv) in a terrible remake of _Get Carter (2000)_ (qv), climbed back into a race car for _Driven (2001)_ (qv), and guest-starred as the \"Toymaker\" in the third chapter of the immensely popular \"Spy Kids\" film series, _Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003)_ (qv). Showing that age had not wearied his two most popular franchises, Stallone has most recently brought back never-say-die boxer Rocky Balboa to star in, well, what else but _Rocky Balboa (2006)_ (qv), and Vietnam veteran _Rambo (2008)_ (qv) will reappear after a 20-year hiatus to once again right wrongs in the jungles of Thailand.Love him or loathe him, 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv) has built an enviable and highly respected career in Hollywood; plus, he has considerably influenced modern popular culture through several of his iconic film characters.::firehouse44@hotmail.com"], "spouse": ["'Jennifer Flavin' (qv)::(17 May 1997 - present) ( 3 children)", "'Brigitte Nielsen' (qv)::(15 December 1985 - 13 July 1987) ( divorced)", "'Sasha Czack' (qv)::(28 December 1974 - 14 February 1985) ( divorced) ( 2 children)"], "trade mark": ["Deep resonant voice and mumbling", "Very muscular physique", "Roles as John Rambo and Rocky Balboa", "Crooked mouth"], "trivia": ["Oil paints in his spare time and considers 'Leonardo Da Vinci' his personal hero.", "On 27 June 1998, his second daughter, 'Sistine Rose Stallone' (qv) was born to third wife, 'Jennifer Flavin' (qv).", "Ranked #92 in Empire (UK) magazine's list of \"The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time\".

We'd be blessed to have him. A real long shot, but life is a long shot - right?", "[on gun control] I know people get upset and go, 'They're going to take away the assault weapon'. But who needs an assault weapon? Like really, unless you're carrying out an assault. You can't hunt with it. Who is going to attack your house - an army?", "Every time I use social media I get really in trouble! I think 'George Clooney' (qv) said it best when he said you've got to be an idiot to be a celebrity and use Twitter. You wake up in the morning when you're sober and your career is over!

I'm doing _Rocky (1976)_ (qv) and the next theatre over it's _Taxi Driver (1976)_ (qv) - he was there with the mohawk, bloody nose, that took some guts to do. I really admire that he just wants to keep going. It was great working with Bobby because he's the complete antithesis of who I am. He's modest, he's quiet, he's reserved and I learned a lot from him.", "[advice to actors who are training to appear as boxers in a musical version of _Rocky (1976)_ (qv)] The hardest thing to do is to sell the punch. You can teach a guy to punch, but the person receiving it has to have the body movement. It starts with the feet, the swivelling of the ankles, the knees and the hips, and then the head goes last. If you just throw punches using your arms it looks like flailing.", "[on casting _The Expendables 3 (2014)_ (qv) and possible future Expendables movies] I was going to go call up 'Jack Nicholson' (qv) and we just got there a little too late, because actually he had said he might be interested in it. So there are still interesting avenues out there. I want to get, if possible, the most unique actors from the past and just put 'em out there once and for all, you know? It just seems like an interesting... quest to do that, because I don't know if it's ever going to happen again. And we're certainly not getting any younger. Well, you know 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) is so involved with what he's doing, so that's kind of a pipe dream.", "[on _The Expendables 3 (2014)_ (qv)] We're trying to make an Event Movie - like _The Avengers (2012)_ (qv). And I think we've accomplished it.", "People think it's easy to make a sequel. It's not, because you've lost the element of surprise. How do you keep putting on layers without getting too pretentious or trying too hard - you know, when in doubt, shout.", "[on _The Expendables 3 (2014)_ (qv)] I believe we finally got it right in the third one - kind of like marriage.", "'Steven Seagal' (qv) said that he, 'Didn't associate with that kind of element' - meaning me. So I slammed him up against a wall. At that time, our testosterone was running full bore. He was full of his height and I was full of... Myself. But we made up. He can be very abstract.", "I am an artistic businessman, both. I think you have to be. It's a matter of self-preservation.", "I was taken off the streets and put into the limos and then groomed and pushed out in poster sales and advertising sporting equipment and whatever...

Success is like a jet stream; it just sucks you along.", "[on the character of Rocky] It's odd - I don't know if it's the first time in the cinema, but it's like I have to live up to the ethics of a fictional character. The identification is so close that I had to stop smoking 'cause people were so offended. They'd say, 'You aren't in training? Rocky wouldn't smoke...' I find it to be so fascinating now. I have been so rewarded by the character. I can't bite the hand that feeds me. It's a fact of life; it's something that I'll always be judged against. Every film I do is going to be judged against _Rocky (1976)_ (qv). It's a fact. I can't fight it anymore.", "[on who intimidated him at the Oscars in 1976] Actually, the person I talked to first, was 'John Wayne' (qv). I didn't know anybody so I was sort of in the corner, feeling very awkward. He walked over and said, \"I'd like to introduce myself. My name is 'John Wayne' (qv).\" I said, \"I recognized you, slightly.\" He was just so humble, and he goes, \"Welcome to the industry. I saw your film, and you were very good.\" That took away my breath, but I relaxed after that, thinking I was just going to sit back and enjoy the show.", "[on _Warrior (2011)_ (qv)] My God, I thought that was amazing. I felt like I knew exactly what those guys were feeling at night. Incredible dedication. 'Joel Edgerton' (qv), those were real performances. I think that the way it was positioned was, just a fight film. But what 'Tom Hardy' (qv), 'Joel Edgerton' (qv) and 'Nick Nolte' (qv) did was, fantastic acting. I was taken aback by how good they were. I think if people had seen it in a Cain and Abel context, it might have been perceived as more of a cautionary tale rather than just a fight film.", "[on directing _Rocky II (1979)_ (qv)] I didn't want to do it; John did a great job and won an Oscar. What had happened is, he didn't quite agree with the subject matter on the second one and just said, \"I don't want to do it.\" Then the producers said, \"Why don't you direct it?\" I said, \"Excuse me?\" That was the adventurousness of 'Irwin Winkler' (qv) and Bob Chartoff. \"You wrote it, you understand it. Why not direct it.\" They gave me the nerve to do it. _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv) hadn't come out yet. I started directing _Rocky II (1979)_ (qv) and decided to work backwards, doing the fight first. So I'm directing that and we move to Philadelphia, and I'm nervous because, how can I come close to Rocky, as a director, but I'm trying. _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv) comes out, and I go to see it during lunch and there are four people in the theater. Four. In Philadelphia, of all places. I went \"Oh my God.\" I had to go back to the set. It didn't work out that badly for Paradise Alley, but my confidence was at an all-time low that day, and I had to tell myself, just keep punching.", "[on _Nighthawks (1981)_ (qv)] Yeah, I remember Nighthawks. Again, a film that didn't find an audience, but I thought 'Rutger Hauer' (qv) was incredible. Maybe it was that urban terrorism wasn't perceived as a serious threat then, and they said, \"Well, this so far-fetched,\" but I liked that film a lot. That was a tough movie. We shot nights, like 40 in a row. The shoot lived up to its title.", "[on pushing himself too hard in the gym] It came right before _Cop Land (1997)_ (qv). I had pushed a little too far and had an erratic heartbeat. So I said, maybe I should do a film that I can have pancakes and French Toast every morning and not stay on a treadmill for hours a day. That was _Cop Land (1997)_ (qv). I had a great time working with Jim Mangold, De Niro and Keitel, and 'Ray Liotta' (qv). This was such a blessing, and I enjoyed it so much. If I could have stayed there, I would have. I loved doing ensemble work with Mangold and 'Harvey Weinstein' (qv) really made a solid film. _Creed (2015)_ (qv) has left me with the same good feeling.", "[on if having action hero status hurt acting opportunities] Absolutely. I think that there's a preconceived notion that an action film is a mindless exercise in visual dexterity. Quite often, they're right. But when you do it in a proper way, say like _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), it's really intriguing, isn't it? You're able to combine all the different skill sets, acting, visual, and the kinetic energy. But it doesn't happen very often, and when you hear the word, \"Action,\" you say, \"Okay, the guy really can't act; all he can do is be very, very physical,\" In a sense you are considered more of an empty vessel. I get that just comes with the territory, and that if you stick around too long, it becomes kind of your epithet.", "The best thing about getting older is...nothing. There's zero good in getting older.", "[Golden Globe Award 2016, thank you speech] I wanna thank my imaginary friend Rocky Balboa, for being the best friend I ever had.", "I love 'Donald Trump' (qv). He's a great Dickensian character. You know what I mean? There are certain people like Arnold, 'Babe Ruth' (qv), that are bigger than life. But I don't know how that translates to running the world.", "I've always thought of Rocky as an individual that was chosen to take a journey that would bring together many \"broken\" people, including himself, and this group would achieve success because of their newfound self-respect. Good old-fashioned Christian values, nothing wrong with that.", "(_Judge Dredd (1995)_ (qv)) From what I recall, the whole project was troubled from the beginning. The philosophy of the film was not set in stone - by that I mean \"Is this going to be a serious drama or with comic overtones\" like other science fiction films that were successful? So a lotta pieces just didn't fit smoothly. It was sort of like a feathered fish. Some of the design work on it was fantastic and the sets were incredibly real, even standing two feet away, but there was just no communication. I knew we were in for a long shoot when, for no explainable reason 'Danny Cannon' (qv), who's rather diminutive, jumped down from his director's chair and yelled to everyone within earshot, \"FEAR me! Everyone should FEAR me!\" then jumped back up to his chair as if nothing happened. The British crew was taking bets on his life expectancy.", "(Asked if he'd ever play a villain) I wouldn't be opposed to playing a truly horrific individual. God knows I saw enough of that growing up. The thing is... whether he's a bloodthirsty, flesh-ripping, Son of Sam-type or more psychologically sadistic, I would definitely opt for the latter. Maybe a remake of When Harry Beat Sally.", "(On writing controversies) First of all, as for 'Chuck Wepner' (qv), he knows the truth and it had nothing do to do with his \"personal life.\" I even regret the fact that he and _Rocky (1976)_ (qv) are associated because the two people couldn't be more diverse. Second of all, I suppose 'James Cameron' (qv) has a point, but in his original draft it took nearly 30-40 pages to have any action initiated and Rambo was partnered with a tech-y sidekick. So it was more than just politics that were put into the script. There was also a simpler story line. If 'James Cameron' (qv) says anything more than that, then he realizes he's now doing the backstroke badly in a pool of lies. And finally, 'Joe Eszterhas' (qv) wrote a script that was nearly 400 pages and was more of a novel than a shootable screenplay. A great deal of work was done by myself, along with Norman Jewison, to hammer it into shape, but Joe had conceived a great concept.", "(Asked if 'James Cameron' (qv) was going to direct _Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985)_ (qv)) No, I think that 'James Cameron' (qv) is a brilliant talent, but I thought the politics were important, such as a right-wing stance coming from Trautman and his nemesis, Murdock, contrasted by Rambo's obvious neutrality, which I believe is explained in Rambo's final speech. I realize his speech at the end may have caused millions of viewers to burst veins in their eyeballs by rolling them excessively, but the sentiment stated was conveyed to me by many veterans.", "(On _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv)) I wrote the book first, then the screenplay. Both I wrote before I'd even thought about _Rocky (1976)_ (qv), so originally they were done in 1974. But I was very broke and I optioned the screenplay of _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv) to a real... how should I say this... maggot, who put his hooks in so deep I could never get it away from him. So the first time I went in to meet Chartoff and Winkler, I was there on an acting job. I didn't get it, but on the way out I said, \"I have this screenplay called _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv).\" They said to bring it over and I did. They wanted to make it, but the other cretin that I had optioned it to was so obnoxious, so overbearing, that the producers wanted nothing to do with me or the screenplay. So on the way out, they said, \"If you have any ideas, we'd be happy to look at them.\" That night I went home - even a fire extinguisher couldn't cool the burning in my brain. The door of opportunity was wide open and I had nothing to carry over its threshold. That's when I started to write _Rocky (1976)_ (qv). So thank God for the maggot; otherwise I never would've written the story of Mr. Balboa.", "It's very simple why _Eye See You (2002)_ (qv) landed in limbo. A film is a very delicate creature. Any adverse publicity or internal shake-up can upset the perception of - and studio confidence in - a feature. For some unknown reason the original producer pulled out and right away the film was considered damaged goods; by the time we ended filming there was trouble brewing on the set because of overages and creative concerns between the director and the studio. The studio let it sit on the shelf for many months and after over a year it was decided to do a re-shoot. We screened it, it tested okay, 'Ron Howard' (qv) was involved with overseeing some of the post-production... but the movie had the smell of death about it. Actually, if you looked up, you could see celluloid buzzards circling as we lay there dying on the distributor's floor. One amusing note: It was funny, when we were met at the airport by the teamsters they'd have a sign in front of them saying Detox, and all these actors like 'Kris Kristofferson' (qv), 'Tom Berenger' (qv) and myself looked like we were going into rehab rather than a film shoot.", "(On his early days) I do remember the windows and they were painted black, simply because my life was dedicated to writing since acting jobs had eluded me. But make no mistake about it, my writing was pretty atrocious in the beginning and my style left a lot to be desired. For example, I would begin writing at 11:00 at night as I listened to 'The Bee Gees' (qv)' Odessa album over and over and over until 5:00 in the morning. The writing never amounted to much, but I memorized all the words to the album. It's safe to say I've long since abandoned that method of writing. The reason I painted the windows is, I didn't want any distractions or excuses to distract me from trying to work, such as, \"My, what a nice day, I think I'll go outside and beg for food.\"", "(On his worst injury from a Rocky film) Well, the worst pre-injury was the torn chest muscles competing in the bench press competition before _Rocky II (1979)_ (qv), and the worst was in _Rocky IV (1985)_ (qv). In the first round, I thought these two characters should hate each other so much that they should just attack each other like pit dogs... professionalism be damned. So what you see in the first twenty seconds is real, and after the third take of taking body blows, I felt a burning in my chest, but ignored it. Later that night I couldn't breathe very well, and they took me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was 200+, and the next thing I knew I was on a low-altitude flight from Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, and there I resided in intensive care for eight days. What had happened is he struck me so hard in the chest that my heart slammed against my breastbone and began to swell, so the beating became labored, and without medical attention the heart would've continued to swell until it stopped. Many people that have car accidents die like this when the steering wheel slams into their chest. So in a sense I was hit by \"a streetcar named Drago.\"", "(Challenging 'Carl Weathers' (qv)'s statement that in a no holds bar match between himself and the other boxng stars of the Rocky) films and he said it would be 'Mr. T' (qv), him, 'Dolph Lundgren' (qv) and Stallone) First of all, my brother Frank used to spar with Carl and chase him around the ring like a fox running from a hound. I saw 'Dolph Lundgren' (qv) pick up Carl and heave him three feet into the corner when I was directing the scene between them; rather than retaliate, Carl got out of the ring and said something ferocious like, \"I'm calling my agent... I quit!\" So in order of boxing skills and fighting ability, I would say 'Dolph Lundgren' (qv), myself, 'Mr. T' (qv), Paulie, and then Apollo Creed.", "(If he directed _Over the Top (1987)_ (qv)) I would have made it less glossy and set it more in an urban environment, for one. Next, I would've not used a never-ending stream of rock songs, but scored music instead, and most likely would've made the event in Vegas more ominous - not so carnival-like.", "(On getting into shape for _First Blood (1982)_ (qv)) The burnt toast rumour is false. I ate perhaps 10-12 eggs per day and only dined on fish so my body was getting ridiculously thin. If I had to do it over again, I would've definitely thrown in some good ol' pasta into that formula, because a strict diet of protein provides no warmth, and let me be clear, that was one cold and brutal shoot.", "I grew up not very confident. I had tons of self-doubt and wasn't physically strong either, so the world appeared to be an extremely large and intimidating sphere. All my life, I always thought that I was alone in these disturbing thoughts, but the older I grew, the more I realized the world is made up of victims, victims of harsh reality, victims of inequality. I thought the most tragic thing one could be confronted with is the prospect of loneliness and the second, the lack of opportunity to prove one's self-worth. So Rocky was just a manifestation of all the underdogs who dream of one day having the opportunity to reach for the stars. They may not get there, but at least the opportunity to show what's in a person's heart is the main goal.", "(On the shower scene with 'Sharon Stone' (qv) in _The Specialist (1994)_ (qv)) Let it be known, I didn't want to do this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decides not to take her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won't take it off. I promised her I wouldn't take any liberties, so what's the problem? She said, \"I'm just sick of nudity.\" I asked her if she could get sick of it on someone else's film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, brought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by 'Michael Douglas' (qv) and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.", "(If he'd ever reunite with 'Kurt Russell' (qv)) No, the chances of that are pretty slim. The idea is intriguing, but it might look a little weathered, like two old ventriloquist dummies trying to play leading men. But thanks for suggesting it because I had a lot of great times on that film. Kurt nailed some of those scenes, like the pro he is.", "(If the Director's Cut of _Cliffhanger (1993)_ (qv) will be released)) No, actually the director's cut was met with a lot of disapproval at the screening and received some alarmingly low scores. Mainly because the stunts were absurdly overblown. For example, the average man can jump maybe twelve feet across a gorge, and the stunts had me leaping maybe three hundred feet or more, so situations like that had to be pared down and still then were fairly extreme... so you're probably better off with this cut. By the way, the 2nd unit crew that filmed the majority of the action was extraordinary.", "(If he's embarrassed by his early films) No, in the early films, I have to admit I enjoyed watching them, only because they were completely carefree and devoid of any movie-star acting tricks, simply because I didn't know any. So it's fun to watch a natural performance without any ego attached. I particularly enjoyed working on _Capone (1975)_ (qv), because it was like the cheesy, mentally challenged inbred cousin of _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv).", "(On 'Burgess Meredith' (qv)) I remember the way Burgess played the scene with me in the apartment in the first _Rocky (1976)_ (qv), and I had never seen such great character work up close. He was just eating me alive with his intensity and nuance. I asked him how did he do that, and he said, \"Because I'm a better pretender than you are.\" I said, \"Pretending?\" and he said, \"Yes, acting - it's just a child's game played by grownups. The biggest child usually wins.\" So from that day on, I tried to specialize in being very immature.", "I love 'Joe Spinell' (qv) and considered him a dear friend and would do anything for him. We had met when I had one or two lines in _Farewell, My Lovely (1975)_ (qv). He was truly one of a kind, but he had some very deep personal problems on the set of _Nighthawks (1981)_ (qv) and became distant. It was around that time his mother also passed away, who he lived for and Joe was never the same.", "(1980 interview with 'Roger Ebert' (qv)) \"It's incredibly difficult to direct yourself in boxing scenes. You're getting the crap beat out of you and trying to think about camera placement at the same time. And another thing, in _Rocky III (1982)_ (qv) the pace is going to have to be quickened. It shouldn't be more than 90 minutes long. In the first two films, Rocky dictated his own pace. This time, like with any heavyweight champion, his pace is being dictated by the people around him. And we'll have a lot of action and be conservative with the dialogue. And also I hope I get out in one piece. For _Rocky II (1979)_ (qv), I got a torn pectoral muscle, I got all beat up inside, I had to have an operation to splice things back together. The mouthpiece saved my teeth. For this one, basically what I need is a mouthpiece for my whole body.\"", "(On _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv) being re-edited) \"I'll never forgive myself for the way I allowed myself to be manipulated during the editing of that film. There were a lot of scenes in there to give atmosphere and character, and they wanted them out just to speed things along. They removed 40 scenes, altogether. I put 10 of them back in for the version shown on TV. For example, the whole sequence of the soldier without legs, sitting in a bar eating peanuts.\"", "Most successful art reflects the exact ideas of the viewer - whether or not the viewer knows it, of course. Paintings that endure are paintings that inspire people to say, hey, that's the way I feel; those are the colours I see in my dreams. Even abstract art depends on that. When you get right down to it, _Rocky (1976)_ (qv) said exactly the same things to a 5-year-old that it said to adults. There was nothing complicated about it.", "(On stunts) \"The way they usually do it is they show you the double taking the hit, and then they cut in for a close-up of the actor's face. It's so phony you can smell it with the cable car sequence in _Nighthawks (1981)_ (qv) for example, it's so phony to show some stuntman hanging from a cable and then cut to the inside of the car and it's me coming in the window. You have to do it on one unfaked take so the audience can see the actor is really doing it.\"", "(1980 interview with 'Roger Ebert' (qv)) \"If I have the nerve, if I have real nerve, Rocky should die at the end of the third film. I was originally thinking in more grandiose terms - the Coliseum and everything - but _Rocky III (1982)_ (qv) should end with more than a fight. It should end with Rocky's life coming full cycle, The way I imagine it, after the fight, he's riding home in a cab, with the roar of the people chanting 'Rocky!' still in his ears. And he just drops over dead. In other words, he has achieved everything possible and he dies when he's on top. I don't think people want to see Rocky when he's 80. I don't know if I'll go with that ending, and him dying. But I know I'll have to film it. I'll have to shoot it for myself, whether or not I use it.\"", "(1980 interview with 'Roger Ebert' (qv)) \"When I'm on a location I pick a restaurant that's close and private and eat all my meals there. This table we're sitting at is directly above my room. That's all the farther I want to go.

I'll eat dirt.\"", "Now, working with 'John Huston' (qv), I'm biting my lip to keep from giving suggestions. There's a misconception that I can't work with other directors. With Huston, he's so into it, he sits back, you don't even think he's working, he's so smooth, but all the time the incubation process is taking place. And he lets you come to him with input if he doesn't like your suggestion, you get a single 'no' and that's it.", "(On doing stunts in _Nighthawks (1981)_ (qv)) \"I take those chances for myself,\" he said. \"I've never been so scared in my life, as when I was dangling from that helicopter. I have a fear of heights that borders on mania. I had to do something like this once in my life. So there I was, hanging 250 feet up over the East River, with the wind blowing me back and forth and the constant danger that if the steel cable hit something it could shear in two. The day before, see, a guy had jumped off the bridge we were working next to. We all saw it happen. He hit the water and exploded. His body broke into several pieces, and the current was so fast that this was the 59th St. Bridge and they pulled the remains out of the water seven minutes later at the 20th St. Pier. I saw that, and had to go up the next day. There was a fireboat down below with two divers in it. I made the mistake of calling them 'lifeguards.' It was explained to me that they were not lifeguards. They were there to retrieve my body, if necessary. If you see the movie and look closely, you'll see that I'm holding a knife in the scene. My theory was that if I fell, the cable would make me sink unless I could cut the harness loose. After I saw that guy hit the water like it was cement, I changed my plan.

If I'd have gotten out of that car, I would have been goulash.", "There's a price you pay. Working in this business, I've met some of the champions, and tried to figure out how they do it. Training for _Rocky (1976)_ (qv), I boxed with 'Muhammad Ali' (qv). Learning how to play soccer...tomorrow morning, I'm gonna get lessons from 'Pel\u00e9' (qv). What's next? I need a little quiet. Maybe chess with Bobby Fischer.", "I got into a lot of trouble with the first interviews I started giving after _Rocky (1976)_ (qv) came out,\" he said. \"I kept some tapes of some of them and I was listening to them the other day. I come over with a pretty big opinion of myself, and I said a lot of things that were supposed to be funny but weren't. I got the critics down on me and they retaliated by attacking _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv). Call it insatiable retribution.\"These days, I'm not one-half as aggressive as I was. I've been working on it. People have seemed to notice it. My energy level is just as high, but I can be more impersonal about myself. I'm learning to take life at face value. Instead of my greed, my demands, I'm turning things over to fate. I was always so serious about everything! Who was I trying to impress? I brought a lot of trouble down on myself. If you're too envious, too hostile, it all comes pouring down on you. There's a natural law of karma that vindictive people, who go out of their way to hurt others, will end up broke and alone.", "All basic laws are very simple. Working on _Nighthawks (1981)_ (qv), for example, I spent 15 weeks in almost, total seclusion in my hotel room, between scenes. Those were the most stressful moments of my life. There had to be another answer. Not drugs: They're a psychological elevator. They move you up, they move you down, but they don't move you ahead. I finally just realized I was taking everything so damned seriously that I was wrecking my own peace of mind. I had to learn to let go.", "(On 'Russell Mulcahy' (qv) directing _Rambo III (1988)_ (qv)) I remember calling him from an editing room and telling him what a wonderful job he had done. He answered back in a bored fashion \"Why thank you darling.\" So I hired him. He went to Israel two weeks before me with the task of casting two dozen vicious looking Russian troops. These men were suppose to make your blood run cold. When I arrived on the set, what I saw was two dozen blond, blue-eyed pretty boys that resembled rejects from a surfing contest. Needless to say Rambo is not afraid of a little competition but being attacked by third rate male models could be an enemy that could overwhelm him. I explained my disappointment to Russell and he totally disagreed, so I asked him and his chiffon army to move on.", "_Nighthawks (1981)_ (qv) was a very difficult film to make namely because no one believed that urban terrorism would ever happen in New York thus felt the story was far fetched. _Nighthawks (1981)_ (qv) was even a better film before the studio lost faith in it and cut it to pieces. What was in the missing scenes was extraordinary acting by 'Rutger Hauer' (qv), 'Lindsay Wagner' (qv), and the finale was a blood fest that rivaled the finale of _Taxi Driver (1976)_ (qv). But it was a blood fest with a purpose. The stunts in the film were pretty extraordinary because they were invented along the way. Running through the tunnels of an un-built subway station was very dangerous, but exciting and we were only given one hour to do it. So that made for an interesting evening. Hanging from the cable car was probably one of the more dangerous stunts I was asked to perform because it was untested and I was asked to hold a folding Gerber knife in my left hand so if the cable were to snap, and I survived the 230 foot fall into the East River with its ice cold 8 mile an hour current, I could cut myself free from the harness because the cable when stretched out weighed more than 300 lbs. I tell you this because it's so stupid to believe that I would survive hitting the water so to go beyond that is absurd. So I actually thought the smart move would be to commit hari-kari on the way down and let the cards fold as they may. P.S. Several years later this cable did snap while testing it on a 100lb bag of sand.", "(On The Hungerford Massacre) 'I carry the can for every lunatic in the world who goes crazy with a gun. 'But it wasn't Rambo who sent Michael Ryan mad. In fact Rambo is the opposite of people like Ryan. He is always up against stronger opposition and never shoots first. Murderers are always saying, \"God told me to kill\" or \"Jesus ordered me to kill\" - so should the rest of us stop praying? There are always sick people out there who will hang their illness on to your hook.'", "Well I mostly keep the memories of the films that were enjoyable to do close to my heart, such as the Rockys, _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv), _F.I.S.T. (1978)_ (qv), _Cliffhanger (1993)_ (qv), _Demolition Man (1993)_ (qv), but the most fun I ever had on a movie was with 'Dolly Parton' (qv) on _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv). I must tell everyone right now that originally the director was supposed to be 'Mike Nichols' (qv), that was the intention and it was supposed to be shot in New York, down and dirty with Dolly and I with gutsy mannerisms performed like two antagonists brought together by fate. I wanted the music at that time to be written by people who would give it sort of a bizarre edge. Believe it or not, I contacted 'Whitesnake' (qv)'s management and they were ready to write some very interesting songs alongside Dolly's. But, I was asked to come down to Fox and out steps the director, 'Bob Clark' (qv). Bob is a nice guy, but the film went in a direction that literally shattered my internal corn meter into smithereens. I would have done many things differently. I certainly would've steered clear of comedy unless it was dark, Belgian chocolate dark. Silly comedy didn't work for me. I mean, would anybody pay to see 'John Wayne' (qv) in a whimsical farce? Not likely. I would stay more true to who I am and what the audience would prefer rather than trying to stretch out and waste a lot of time and people's patience.", "(On 'Andrey Konchalovskiy' (qv)) Andrei was a real gentleman and I thought his take on _Tango & Cash (1989)_ (qv) was very good and would've been infinitely more realistic had he been allowed to continue. His replacement was more attuned to comic pop culture so the film had a dramatic shift into a more light hearted direction.", "I would love to work with 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) and had heard rumours about this World War II epic. I would be insane not to work with such a brilliant filmmaker. I was hoping to work with Quentin in his new _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) film, but unfortunately Rocky and _Rambo (2008)_ (qv) duties prevented that from happening.", "Once you've been at the helm of a film and understand the basics of 101 filmmaking, you watch other directors with an educated eye. Its like if a film is going out of control, you want to contribute and quite often, a director resists any help because it usurps his power. I can understand this. I remember my first day on _Judge Dredd (1995)_ (qv) when 'Danny Cannon' (qv) had been chosen as the director. I knew there was going to be difficulties in communication between actors, director and crewmembers, and that's exactly what happened. So I believe the film reflects that lack of unity.", "(If he'd do anything from his films differently) I would've played _Oscar (1991)_ (qv) incredibly cynical like the original French version and I would've gone back to my original premise of _Rambo III (1988)_ (qv), which was more in keeping with the theme of _Tears of the Sun (2003)_ (qv), but set in Afghanistan.", "(If he was asked to appear in _Terminator Salvation (2009)_ (qv)) No, that has never happened and I believe that's sacred ground for Arnold and would be an insult to encroach on his territory.", "The worst film I've ever made by far... maybe one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we've never seen... a flatworm could write a better script then _Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992)_ (qv). In some countries - China, I believe - running _Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992)_ (qv) once a week on government television has lowered the birth rate to zero. If they ran it twice a week, I believe in twenty years China would be extinct.", "(On writing _Driven (2001)_ (qv)) I'd gone through - and this is not bragging but showing my inadequacies in being able to get it right - about 25 drafts. And of those, about 20 were about this one man's journey, myself, through this film, and all his trials and tribulations. He'd fallen from a great height career-wise. He was a drunkard with all these problems and accidents because he and his wife Cathy, who's played by 'Gina Gershon' (qv), had this very tumultuous relationship. (Laughs) I'm giving you a little biographical hint here. And he just started to come apart. So he was brought back as kind of like how people should never be. It's like taking kids who are truants and then taking them to prison to see where they'll end up and scaring them straight.So I was brought back to basically prove to young Jimmy Bly how he should never be, as a bad example. And then the more we worked on it, it became the dark side, a little seedy, and I didn't know where the upside of it was ever going to be. So we began to reduce his role and make it more of an ensemble, so he's just there as a guy who did his job, wasn't very spectacular, would race like hell, sometimes he'd win, sometimes lose, but he had a certain work ethic code, that old school that could be applied to Jimmy. So that all made it more ensemble, and then in the editing we reduced it even more. I originally had a relationship going with the reporter. But that began to de-emphasise the other people, so we put that on the back burner.", "(On changing _Rambo (2008)_ (qv)'s title) \"You know Lionsgate jumped the gun on this. I just was thinking that the title John Rambo was derivative of _Rocky Balboa (2006)_ (qv) and might give people the idea that this is the last Rambo film, and I don't necessarily feel that it will be. He's not an athlete, there's no reason he can't continue onto another adventure. Like 'John Wayne' (qv) with _The Searchers (1956)_ (qv).\"", "(On Adrian's death in _Rocky Balboa (2006)_ (qv)) \"In the original script, she was alive,\" reveals Stallone, 60. \"But it just didn't have the same dramatic punch. I thought, 'What if she's gone?' That would cut Rocky's heart out and drop him down to ground zero.\"", "(On _Driven (2001)_ (qv)) A lot of it's autobiographical. Racing's very much like the world of acting. You have your front runners and you have guys that are there for the long race, and you have other guys that block for other people, that are called supporting and character actors. It's all the same kind of situation. And you realize that you can't always be No. 1. You just can't be the guy in front all the time. So what you can do is lend support to, and help and nourish and encourage someone else. So it's like your experiences live on in someone else. If you can find some young actor and you can say, 'Listen, don't do this and don't do that and avoid this and that,' and share your experiences, and he does succeed, you can say, 'You know what, I kind of contributed to that.' As an actor did you have to learn you can't always be No.1 the hard way? (Laughs) Unfortuantely I did.", "(On which films he wished he hadn't done) Let me think..._Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992)_ (qv), _Oscar (1991)_ (qv), _Get Carter (2000)_ (qv), _Driven (2001)_ (qv), _Eye See You (2002)_ (qv) and certainly _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv), which I wish had been _Romancing the Stone (1984)_ (qv).", "\"_Rocky (1976)_ (qv) was probably the purest of all my performances and the most insightful. It was far better received than I ever thought it would be. Being naive, I thought I was basically doing a film to while away the summer.The most important scene was going to be cut for lack of money [Rocky's prefight crisis of confidence, when he confides to 'Talia Shire' (qv)'s Adrian, \"I can't beat him. Who'm I kidding? All I want to do is go the distance.\"]. They were literally packing up the equipment. But I stood my ground. So they said, 'Okay, you only get one take, no angles, no coverage.' The next day, they said, 'You know, Sly, that's the most important scene in the movie.' I said, 'Thank you.\"'", "(On _Rocky II (1979)_ (qv)) \"Once you've tasted success, to follow that up is almost as interesting. Of the Rockys, it was kind of overlooked, but I think it was one of the better written ones. Everyone had their characters so down, all I had to do was say, 'Action.\"'", "(On _Paradise Alley (1978)_ (qv)) \"Also one of my better performances. The character I play is kind of distasteful, but I never worked more on trying to catch the Damon Runyonesque speech pattern. I loved directing. It just seemed to go naturally with my hyperactivity. Again - I use the word a lot - there was that naivete. But that's what was special about the early years before I became the old pro.\"", "(On _The Lords of Flatbush (1974)_ (qv)_) \"I have very fond memories of it. The acting was very naturalistic because we were really winging it, and I didn't know any 'cinema tricks.\"'", "(On _F.I.S.T. (1978)_ (qv)) A real eye-opener. That was the beginning of me understanding that I'd been typecast as _Rocky (1976)_ (qv). _F.I.S.T.

But we cut it to about 90 minutes, and the result was, I think, one of the better vehicles I've ever been in.\"", "(On _Rocky III (1982)_ (qv)) \"To me, it's the smoothest of them all. Again I went back into my life. Now Rocky'd become very successful, and he'd lost his eye of the tiger, his edge. He'd developed fear of trying to do things new and unknown.
