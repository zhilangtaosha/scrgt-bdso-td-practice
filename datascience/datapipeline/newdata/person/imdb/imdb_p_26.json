Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s.Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High School (though he dropped out at seventeen), he secured a bit part in _Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career. But a job reading lines with actors auditioning for uncle Francis' _Rumble Fish (1983)_ (qv) landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in _Valley Girl (1983)_ (qv), which was released first and truly launched his career.His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor's remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in _The Cotton Club (1984)_ (qv).In his early 20s, he dated 'Jenny Wright' (qv) for two years and later linked to 'Uma Thurman' (qv). After a relationship of several years with 'Christina Fulton' (qv), a model, they split amicably and share custody of a son, 'Weston Cage Coppola' (qv) (b.1992).

Before we went on he said to me, \"Why aren't you wearing your leather jacket? Didn't you learn anything from 'Dennis Hopper' (qv)?\" Because I was wearing a suit. Then I went out and started talking about how if Picasso could paint surreal, why couldn't actors try to achieve that as well? Then Miles came on, and he was very considerate and he said, \"I hear what you're saying.\" He kept looking at me like we had our own connection. Ever since then he stayed in my thoughts. He said the words I needed to hear to keep going with my choices. It's weird because my surrealist name, Cage, is actually taken from a black character, Luke Cage.", "The first time that I played _Ghost Rider (2007)_ (qv). Blaze was easy; I knew he was a man who had been living with a curse for 8 years of having his head light on fire, and the tone that would take. I compared him to a cop, or a paramedic who develops a dark sense of humour to cope with the horrors he has seen. But Blaze has also caused the horrors, so he's hiding out because he doesn't want to hurt anyone else. Ghost Rider was an entirely new experience, and he got me thinking.", "I think that _Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011)_ (qv) was mentally taxing, if only because I had to go to a Christmas party shortly after I had wrapped photography in Romania at 2 in the morning as the Ghost Rider. The invitation had a Christmas ornament on it with Ghost Rider's face on it as a tree. I had a couple of schnapps and went to the party; I had not entirely let go of whatever magic I had been channelling, and all hell broke lose. In fact, I think I kept saying over and over: \"Merry Christmas, you assholes!\" I am lucky I'm not in a Romanian prison.", "Superman is an American myth. Like the English have Shakespeare.", "I would like to see a sequel to _Lord of War (2005)_ (qv). I think it would work really well, especially in this day and age where guns are at the center of political discussion. And also the boy in the movie, my son, there's this idea that he grows up and he goes into the trade and then I'm trying to get him out of it. I think that could be a very interesting movie.", "I hate violence. I just hate it. I read the paper every day - the New York Times, The Guardian - and I feel it, you know? It gets inside. I'm amazed that people are capable of those kinds of things to children and women.", "I'm up for anything that will get me to the truth of a performance.", "There's very few things that make me laugh. 'Mike Myers' (qv) as Austin Powers makes me laugh - that was genius - and Daffy Duck makes me laugh, but I like odd behavior. I don't like hip dialogue and one-liners and all that sort of cool, sophomoric comedy. It's just not for me.", "I'm one of those guys where the more coffee I drink, the more stunts I do, the more relaxed I get.", "[on having a stalker] That was horrible. I mean, that's as bad as it gets: 2am and there's a naked man standing in front of your bed watching you sleep. It's not funny, but somehow people find it amusing.", "Halloween is a great holiday for any actor if you think about it. It's all about dress-up and playing characters. So yeah, it's always had a special place for me.", "[on the most haunted place he's ever been to] There's a house I used to live in called The LaLaurie Mansion on Royal Street in New Orleans, and it's notorious as the most haunted house in the United States. I spent time in there alone in total darkness to get some inspiration to write the great American horror novel, but I didn't get far. I'm not gonna go into detail.", "Film acting is one of the only industries where you're criticized for working hard. In any other industry it's considered a quality and something to behold.", "I haven't isolated myself. I am not living on a yacht somewhere. I am not tucked away or behind a gate somewhere. I am not flying on a private plane. I am going to the airport, I am with people, some of the interactions are good, some of them are not so good, but it keeps me in touch with being, you know, part of society. And I think that's necessary to stay relevant to be able to tell stories about people, which is what actors do.", "Sometimes your very own family that you're close to can be toxic. They take your success or your potential as a personal insult on their failure, and they beat you up or they say you'll never make it.", "Now even the art of film criticism... now in the LA Times, the critic who reviewed _Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009)_ (qv), incorporated how many homes I bought or sold into the review. What the hell does 'Lindsay Lohan' (qv)'s personal life have to do with her performance in _The Canyons (2013)_ (qv)? It should always be about the work itself. What difference does it make if 'Bill Clinton' (qv) had an affair -- how does that affect his performance as President?", "I started acting because I wanted to be 'James Dean' (qv). I saw him in _Rebel Without a Cause (1955)_ (qv), _East of Eden (1955)_ (qv). Nothing affected me -- no rock song, no classical music -- the way Dean affected in \"Eden.\" It blew my mind. I was like, \"That's what I want to do.\" This was before everyone had a thing called a Smartphone, and before the advent of the \"celebutard\" -- just being famous for famous' sake. I'm not complaining, but it really sucks to be famous right now.", "I am in the process of reinventing myself. I am returning to my roots, which is independently spirited, dramatic characters. I had taken a year off to re-evaluate everything I had done, different kinds of performances I had done, the more operatic and more baroque stuff like _Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011)_ (qv), _Drive Angry (2011)_ (qv) or _Season of the Witch (2011)_ (qv). I wanted to find something where I could use my life experience, my memories and my emotions.\"", "I started acting because I wanted to be 'James Dean' (qv).

I'm not complaining, but it really sucks to be famous right now.", "I don't take criticism seriously and I don't take praise seriously, both would be a mistake. If you buy into the negative that is the Internet today, or the cynical critic, it's not unlike listening to an abusive father that's trying to cave you in and you can't function. If you buy into praise, to people who adore you, you might get lazy and say, 'Well, I'll just keep doing that.' You have to stay uncomfortable. I learned that from 'David Bowie' (qv). I said, 'How do you do it? How do you keep reinventing yourself?' He said, 'I just never got comfortable with anything I was doing.' I knew those were words of wisdom from a great artist and I took those words seriously.", "I'd love to make a movie with 'Jack Nicholson' (qv). I don't know why it hasn't happened yet! But I think the two of us together, would [laughs] ... I'm sure it would be something to talk about! I feel very comfortable with him and I think we would do something special together.", "[on being sought by 'Cher' (qv) to join the cast of _Moonstruck (1987)_ (qv)] I don't really know why she wanted me in the movie. She kept fighting for me. She saw me in _Peggy Sue Got Married (1986)_ (qv) and said it was like watching a two-hour train wreck. It was pretty intimidating to be her leading man.", "[on developing performance style] I [wanted]to get more 'quietude' - what Hemingway would call the taut fishing line. I wanted to have that simplicity again. _Joe (2013)_ (qv) gave me the opportunity to explore that.. I see myself as a student. I'll hopefully do more seasoned kinds of performance as I get older.", "[advice to aspiring screen actors] If you're doing something really extraordinary, chances are you'll be an original. That might scare some people in the casting office. They might not know what to do with that. What I would suggest is to put a frame on it. Tape your audition. Put your performance in a frame so they can see it, and then go into the office. But I would send the tape. If you are genuinely talented, you are to be doing things that are special. So put a frame on it.", "When I did _Joe (2013)_ (qv) it was an opportunity for me to get what I call 'naked' as a film presence. It was time to not put things on top of a performance, but take things off - where I could take my life experience of the last years and find a script where I didn't have to act. Where I could just be, and not think too much about it. What was a great compliment was when my wife saw it with me in Venice and said, 'That's you'.", "I try to pick ans choose my material based on what I can do to challenge myself and make myself uncomfortable. Always stay a student, never be a maestro.", "There is a mischievous mind at work on _The Wicker Man (2006)_ (qv), you know? You know what I mean? And I finally kind of said, 'I might have known that the movie was meant to be absurd.' But saying that now after the fact is OK, but to say it before the fact is not, because you have to let the movie have its own life.", "(On The Coen Brothers) \"Joel and Ethan have a very strong vision and I've learned how difficult it is to accept another artist's vision.
