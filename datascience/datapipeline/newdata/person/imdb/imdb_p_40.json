He is the middle of three children of a beautician mother, Lennis, from Georgia, and a Pentecostal minister father, 'Denzel Washington' (qv), Sr., from Virginia. After graduating from high school, Denzel enrolled at Fordham University, intent on a career in journalism. However, he caught the acting bug while appearing in student drama productions and, upon graduation, he moved to San Francisco and enrolled at the American Conservatory Theater. He left A.C.T. after only one year to seek work as an actor. His first paid acting role was in a summer stock theater stage production in St. Mary's City, Maryland. The play was \"Wings of the Morning\", which is about the founding of the colony of Maryland (now the state of Maryland) and the early days of the Maryland colonial assembly (a legislative body). He played the part of a real historical character, Mathias Da Sousa, although much of the dialogue was created. Afterwards he began to pursue screen roles in earnest. With his acting versatility and powerful presence, he had no difficulty finding work in numerous television productions.He made his first big screen appearance in _Carbon Copy (1981)_ (qv) with 'George Segal' (qv). Through the 1980s, he worked in both movies and television and was chosen for the plum role of Dr. Philip Chandler in NBC's hit medical series _St. Elsewhere (1982)_ (qv), a role that he would play for six years. In 1989, his film career began to take precedence when he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Tripp, the runaway slave in 'Edward Zwick' (qv)'s powerful historical masterpiece _Glory (1989)_ (qv).Washington has received much critical acclaim for his film work since the 1990s, including his portrayals of real-life figures such as South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko in _Cry Freedom (1987)_ (qv), Muslim minister and human rights activist 'Malcolm X' (qv) in 'Malcolm X' (qv) (1992), boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter in _The Hurricane (1999)_ (qv), football coach 'Herman Boone' (qv) in _Remember the Titans (2000)_ (qv), poet and educator Melvin B. Tolson in _The Great Debaters (2007)_ (qv), and drug kingpin Frank Lucas in _American Gangster (2007)_ (qv). 'Malcolm X' (qv) and The Hurricane garnered him Oscar nominations for Best Actor, before he finally won that statuette in 2002 for his lead role in _Training Day (2001)_ (qv).Through the 1990s, Denzel also co-starred in such big budget productions as _The Pelican Brief (1993)_ (qv), _Philadelphia (1993)_ (qv), _Crimson Tide (1995)_ (qv), _The Preacher's Wife (1996)_ (qv), and _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv), a role for which he was paid $10 million. He continued to define his onscreen persona as the tough, no-nonsense hero through the 2000s in films like _Out of Time (2003)_ (qv), _Man on Fire (2004)_ (qv), _Inside Man (2006)_ (qv), and _The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009)_ (qv). Cerebral and meticulous in his film work, he made his debut as a director with _Antwone Fisher (2002)_ (qv); he also directed _The Great Debaters (2007)_ (qv) and _Fences (2016)_ (qv).In 2010, Washington headlined _The Book of Eli (2010)_ (qv), a post-Apocalyptic drama. Later that year, he starred as a veteran railroad engineer in the action film _Unstoppable (2010)_ (qv), about an unmanned, half-mile-long runaway freight train carrying dangerous cargo. The film was his fifth and final collaboration with director 'Tony Scott' (qv), following _Crimson Tide (1995)_ (qv), _Man on Fire (2004)_ (qv), _D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (2006)_ (qv) and The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3. He has also been a featured actor in the films produced by 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv) and has been a frequent collaborator of director 'Spike Lee' (qv).In 2012, Washington starred in _Flight (2012)_ (qv), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. He co-starred with 'Ryan Reynolds' (qv) in _Safe House (2012)_ (qv), and prepared for his role by subjecting himself to a torture session that included waterboarding. In 2013, Washington starred in _2 Guns (2013)_ (qv), alongside 'Mark Ryan Walberg' (qv). In 2014, he starred in _The Equalizer (2014)_ (qv), an action thriller film directed by 'Antoine Fuqua' (qv) and written by 'Richard Wenk' (qv), based on the television series of same name starring 'Edward Woodward' (qv). During this time period, he also took on the role of producer for some of his films, including The Book of Eli and Safe House.In 2016, he was selected as the recipient for the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award at the 73rd Golden Globe 'Awards' (qv).He lives in Los Angeles, California with his wife, 'Pauletta Washington' (qv), and their four children.::Tom McDonough and Pedro Borges"], "spouse": ["'Pauletta Washington' (qv)::(25 June 1983 - present) ( 4 children)"], "trade mark": ["Often portrays real people: Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter in _The Hurricane (1999)_ (qv), 'Malcolm X' (qv) in 'Malcolm X' (qv) (1992), 'Herman Boone' (qv) in _Remember the Titans (2000)_ (qv), Frank Lucas in _American Gangster (2007)_ (qv), Steve Biko in _Cry Freedom (1987)_ (qv) and Melvin Tolson in _The Great Debaters (2007)_ (qv).", "Frequently plays military commanders and law enforcement officers", "In almost all the films - e.g. _Man on Fire (2004)_ (qv), _American Gangster (2007)_ (qv), _John Q (2002)_ (qv) - where he handles or uses sidearms (usually a 9mm Beretta or similar pistols), there's a scene of him swiftly ejecting a bullet from the loaded chamber by pulling back the slide assembly and subsequently catching the bullet before it falls to the ground.", "Fiery anger-driven tirades", "Frequently works with directors 'Spike Lee' (qv), 'Tony Scott' (qv), 'Edward Zwick' (qv), and 'Antoine Fuqua' (qv)", "Frequently when his character is making a decision or changing his course of action, he will say, \"Okay.

I'm just an actor who is more popular right now. I don't even know what a movie star is.

Now I'm not being naive. I know that marketing comes into play when you're spending 50 or 60 million dollars of other people's money to make a film. You have to be involved in marketing that product. But the publicity gets to be boring. How many times can I tell the same story? I understand the importance of doing publicity for a film, so I'm willing to do that, but I don't want to sit around talking about myself. That's not a great day for me. That's not my idea of fun.", "The acting coach Stanislavsky talks about cutting 90 percent. So you do research, research, research, then you drop it and listen when you're in the scene and know who you are. You never know how it's gonna come around. That's why you go out there and find out. It's because you need the human beings that hook you into the character. Maybe I'm not as imaginative as the average actor. I need some kind of a hook sometimes.", "Man gives you the award but God gives you the reward.", "[on the 2002 Academy 'Awards' (qv) and his win] - I didn't want to go to the Oscars. After Hurricane, I was like, \"I don't feel like dealing with these people. I'm just not going to go.\" In order to protect yourself, you almost have to not care. So that night I didn't care -- and, of course, they go, \"Here\".", "[on _The Book of Eli (2010)_ (qv)] - We shot in New Mexico, and the environment definitely helped. It was bleak. It got chilly and windy. The wind was the biggest deal. You'd have to wash the sand out of your nose and eyes. The world that the movie takes place in, the opportunity to do all this \"Blade\" kind of martial-arts stuff, working with the Hughes brothers -- it was an interesting combination of things.", "[on _Training Day (2001)_ (qv)] - My son talked me into doing that movie. He was like, 'Dad, you've never done anything like this'. I just hadn't been asked before. The only film that was sort of dark that I'd turned down was __Se7en (1995)_ (qv)_. They offered me the 'Brad Pitt' (qv) part, but I was like, \"This is so dark and evil.\" Then when I saw the movie, I was like, \"Oh, shoot\".", "[on the supposed factual inaccuracies of _The Hurricane (1999)_ (qv)] - I heard that. We'll never know, will we? The film was touchy because people were murdered and a lot of people felt that Rubin did it. So you're opening old wounds. 'Malcolm X' (qv) (1992) was more dangerous, but _The Hurricane (1999)_ (qv) might have been more controversial.", "[on _Philadelphia (1993)_ (qv)] - [Director] 'Jonathan Demme' (qv) said to me, 'Look, we don't want your character to go 360 degrees. It's not like by the end of the movie he's leading a gay and lesbian parade'. If we'd done that, it would have let people like this character off the hook. But at the end, he touches ['Tom Hanks' (qv)' character] -- and that's huge for him. [Pauses, then laughs] I used to mess with Tom. He was barely eating at all, and I would put out, like, 200 Almond Joys in his drawer to give him a hard time. I'd pretend to sneeze and all these Snickers would fall on the ground. I'm sure he laughed all the way up to the podium when he won the Oscar.", "[on the whipping scene in _Glory (1989)_ (qv)] - I remember walking around before that scene, just praying and calling on the spirits of all the slaves, because I didn't know how to play it. I was like, \"Okay, fellas, just tell me what to do.\" And I went out there with an arrogance. I spit on the ground. I had this attitude and this strength -- it all came out of this meditation. It wasn't calculated. It was organic. That whip actually hurt, but I was like, \"Don't let him win.\"", "(1995 quote) It was never my dream to be famous. I didn't start acting to be a movie star. I started in the theater and my desire was to get better at my craft. It's still my desire. I don't consider myself a movie star, nor do I really have the desire to be one. I'm just an entertainer. An actor who works hard at his craft. Whatever labels people give me, that's not really me or part of my process. Come and talk with me again on my 50th birthday and I may feel differently, but right now, I'm just taking the lesson from one of my old teachers who said, \"Don't be afraid to fail big.\".", "(1995 quote) This \"famous\" stuff, I guess you can get caught up in it. You can even get caught up in fighting it, pretending it doesn't exist. But it already alters who you are, just in the fact that you're trying to deny it. I just turned 40 and my wife and I had a quiet getaway. I didn't want a big party or anything. I just wanted to reflect on what I've done with the first 40 years and what I want to do now. I think I'm just starting to figure out how to do it, you know, how to simplify things in life. Around my birthday, I was listening to this motivational speaker, Les Brown, who made this analogy about ghosts around his bed. He was saying when you die, imagine you had these ghosts around your bed that represent your unfulfilled potential. Things that should have been done, should have been experienced. How many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes? People can say about me or anyone, \"Oh, you're great at this\", but you have to look at yourself and say, \"How do I feel about what I've done?\". That's all that matters.", "Long ago, I made a commitment to completely cut out drinking and anything that might hamper me from getting my mind and body together. And the floodgates of goodness have opened upon me, spiritually and financially.", "'Tony Scott' (qv) was a great director, a genuine friend, and it is unfathomable to think that he is now gone.
