By the age of ten, she had performed and taken the lead in various Stagecoach productions and school plays.In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Sorcerers (2001), the film adaptation of British author J.K.

They all ask exactly the same questions and you can say exactly the same answers! You don't have to think, you can just stand there like a broken record going LALALA.", "[on working with boys]: I like being around mixed company.

It means I can do things I really care about, like _The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)_ (qv), which might not have been made otherwise. Being a teenager is quite lonely, particularly for my generation. There's a sense of people being cut off and in isolation. And when I read the script, it just made me feel less alone.

I just needed some time to sort of put myself back together a bit.", "[on childhood fame]: If I went to somewhere busy, I wouldn't last very long. I can't go to a museum, I'll last 10 or 15 minutes in a museum. The problem is that when one person asks for a photograph, then someone sees a flash goes off, then everyone else sort of... It's sort of like a domino effect. And then very quickly the situation starts to get out of control to a point where I can't manage it on my own.", "I guess, weirdly in my head, I knew what I wanted. I didn't know how it would, or if it would, ever happen. But before _The Bling Ring (2013)_ (qv) I said I'd really wanted to meet 'Sofia Coppola' (qv) and - this is before I knew that she had a film in mind - ended up meeting her. And Darren was someone who actually I met a good year ago. And then I'm doing a film with 'Guillermo del Toro' (qv) next summer, and I went to him and said Warner Brothers have given me the script for 'Beauty and the Beast,' but the only way I'd really want to do it is if you did it.

You're not with a group of people all the time at one time.", "My grandma said - when I was really young and I'd sing along to the radio - why do you sing in an American accent? I guess it was because a lot of the music I was listening to had American vocalists. And that was something Steve said to me as well: try singing the lines in an American accent. That kind of opened me up. Then I worked with a dialogue coach and I just put in the time to really, really listen and just go over it and over it and over it until I could do it without thinking about it too hard. And I just knew it was really important.", "I don't date people who are famous. I don't think it's fair that, all of a sudden, intimate details of their personal life are public as a direct result of me. I wish I could protect them.", "If I've learned anything, it's really just to stop trying to find answers and certainties.", "In my downtime, I don't sex myself up much. Sometimes I have a hard time convincing directors that I can play adult roles.", "I'm a feminist, but I think that romance has been taken away a bit for my generation.

Also, I'm the worst liar ever.", "I'm aware that I'm kind of a paradox, and at times a bit ill-suited to my profession. But there's something that brings me back.
