He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theatre manager, in an artists' housing project in New York City's Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father's background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\".His first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin's fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York's hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to 'Vin Diesel' (qv).Following high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \"Feature Films at used Car Prices\" by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv), which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.Afterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, _Strays (1997)_ (qv). Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) was impressed by _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv). _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv) earned Vin more work, when the director of _The Iron Giant (1999)_ (qv) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin's career steadily grew, with him securing his first lead role, as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film _Pitch Black (2000)_ (qv). The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves.Since then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles: _The Fast and the Furious (2001)_ (qv), _xXx (2002)_ (qv), _The Pacifier (2005)_ (qv), _Fast & Furious (2009)_ (qv), _Fast Five (2011)_ (qv), _Fast & Furious 6 (2013)_ (qv), and _Furious 7 (2015)_ (qv). He also voiced Groot in _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_ (qv) and starred in the lower-budgeted courtroom drama _Find Me Guilty (2006)_ (qv), the latter directed by 'Sidney Lumet' (qv).::Lilith <webmistress@vindiesel.co.uk>"], "trade mark": ["Shaves his head", "Muscular physique", "Deep, gravelly, powerful voice", "Big, lanky boots"], "trivia": ["He worked as a bouncer in New York at the famous nightclubs Tunnel (which has since closed) and Mars.", "Has a fraternal twin brother, 'Paul Vincent' (qv), who is a film editor.", "Has an Italian Mastiff named \"Roman\".", "Has a younger sister, 'Samantha Vincent' (qv), and a younger brother, in addition to his fraternal twin Paul.", "Ranked #46 in Premiere magazine's 2003 annual Power 100 List.

In the ending of this movie, it's not just something that says we're opening it up so we can tell another story, it's very specific. A very daring ending because it's left open-ended.", "From the very very beginning, when everyone thought it was crazy, I was thinking of _The Chronicles of Riddick (2004)_ (qv) as a trilogy. That would start with the movie you saw, and _Pitch Black (2000)_ (qv) would act as a prequel that introduced you to the character. So in simple terms, in Chronicles 2 we venture to the Underverse. We knew we could get away with a PG-13 on the first one, but once you go to the Underverse it's rated R, because it's a place where war is the norm and there is constant, constant battling.
