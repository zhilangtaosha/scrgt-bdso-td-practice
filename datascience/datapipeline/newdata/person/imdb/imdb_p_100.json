He, and younger sister Makena, were raised in a well-mannered, Roman Catholic household in Hudsonville, Michigan. He is of English, German, Dutch, and Scottish descent. At the age of six, Taylor began studying martial arts at Fabiano's Karate School and he, along with his family, quickly noticed his unique and natural talent for the sport. He was soon invited to train with seven-time world karate champion Michael Chaturantabut (aka Mike Chat) and, at the age of eight, he was asked to represent his country in the twelve years and under division in the World Karate Association where he became the Junior World Forms and Weapons champion, winning three gold medals. In 2003, Taylor continued to flourish in the martial arts circuit where he ranked number one in the world for NASKA's Black Belt Open Forms, Musical Weapons, Traditional Weapons and Traditional Forms and, at the age of twelve, he became the three time Junior World Champion.However, in addition to his love for martial arts, Taylor quickly developed a love for acting at the age of seven years old when his martial arts instructor, who was involved in show business, encouraged him to audition for a small appearance in a Burger King commercial. Although he was unsuccessful, he enjoyed the experience so much that he told his parents that he wanted to pursue a career in acting. Soon, he and his family were traveling back-and-forth from their home in Michigan to California so Taylor could audition for acting roles on a regular basis. When Taylor was ten, with the frequent traveling and air fares starting to become overwhelming, his family made the crucial decision to relocate to Los Angeles where Taylor would have the advantage of being able to audition for films, television, and commercials full-time.Once Taylor moved with his family to Los Angeles, he found himself landing more and more small acting roles. He booked many occurring roles on various television shows such as _My Wife and Kids (2001)_ (qv), _Summerland (2004)_ (qv), and _The Bernie Mac Show (2001)_ (qv). Taylor also found himself becoming successful in films as well. In 2005, he landed the role of Sharkboy in the family blockbuster flick, _The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005)_ (qv), and the role of Eliot Murtaugh in _Cheaper by the Dozen 2 (2005)_ (qv). However, it would be one single role that would ultimately change Taylor's life forever. In 2008, Taylor auditioned for the iconic role of werewolf hunk Jacob Black in the record smashing, blockbuster hit _Twilight (2008)_ (qv). With the sudden and unexpected success of the film, Taylor, along with fellow cast members 'Robert Pattinson' (qv) and 'Kristen Stewart' (qv), found himself being propelled into a world that would forever change his life and his career.Taylor has continued to portray Jacob Black in the following film adaptations of the The Twilight Saga as well as branch out into other roles and films such as the star studded romantic comedy, _Valentine's Day (2010)_ (qv), and the action-packed thriller, _Abduction (2011)_ (qv). 'Taylor Lautner' (qv) has quickly become one of the most famous, talented, and successful young Hollywood actors thanks to the blockbuster success of the _Twilight (2008)_ (qv) films. It has quickly been established by this young man's diverse and gifted talent that we will continue to be his audience for many years to come.::Anonymous"], "trade mark": ["His abs"], "trivia": ["Taylor is a keen martial artist who, from the age of seven, has won many karate tournaments on a local, national and international level.", "He is a big sports fan and his favorite sport is football.

I don't know...one of my favorite movies is _The Notebook (2004)_ (qv) so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It's about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.", "[About presenting at the Oscars for the first time] I was freaking! It's probably the most nervous I've ever been. Just standing up on that stage and looking down at the people that you've watched your entire life. It was crazy...I wouldn't let myself lock eyes with any one person because I would have just stopped talking. If I would have locked eyes with Leo ('Leonardo DiCaprio' (qv)) or 'George Clooney' (qv) or someone I would not have been able to speak so I was trying to avoid that.", "[About his new found fame and avoiding the paparazzi] Yeah, you definitely use a lot of back-entrances and exits, but I think for the most part, we (meaning his fellow _Twilight (2008)_ (qv) cast members, 'Robert Pattinson' (qv) and 'Kristen Stewart' (qv)) just go along for the ride. We're the same people that we were before and we have people behind us that kind of help us think ahead and we're just thankful to have that help. When we walk through hotels, we always walk through the kitchen or through the garbage room or the laundry room. It's that not glamorous, trust me.", "[About hosting _Saturday Night Live (1975)_ (qv) for the first time] They tell you beforehand that \"the cast is great, you're not going to be nervous, your just going to have fun\" and I was like \"yeah, okay\" and don't get me wrong I had a lot of fun, but I was nervous. When I got the offer for it, I was like \"Listen guys it's such an honor, but I don't sing, I don't dance, and I don't do accents and that's pretty much what SNL is\" so I was really nervous, but it was a lot of fun.", "A dream acting role would be 'Matt Damon' (qv) in the Bourne series. I would love to do something like that!", "[About his favorite quote from 'Twilight'] It's not in the first book, but the quote I love the most is Jacob's quote, \"Does my being half-naked bother you?\" That quote just cracks me up. Because he's always half-naked throughout the series, it's just a good way to rock the fact that he's always shirtless.", "[About his experience with the 'Twilight' fans in Brazil] When we (meaning himself and 'Kristen Stewart' (qv)) traveled to Brazil to promote _The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009)_ (qv), we were told ahead of time that our Brazilian fans may possibly be a little more enthusiastic then the fans we were used to. We weren't too worried. But one day when we were doing interviews in our hotel room, our security guard rushes into the room and tells us to remain calm, but 2,000 girls just stormed the hotel lobby and were on their way up to our room.

But I predicted from the beginning that we would all be upset and on the last day, it did get emotional.", "[on filming _Abduction (2011)_ (qv)] When I saw the script, it had probably five or six shirtless scenes, and it got cut down to one short one.
