There's this one fight scene with 'Liam Neeson' (qv) toward the end, where it's, like, the apex of the work. We finished and 'Joe Carnahan' (qv)'s like \"Brother, come here, look at this,\" and he played it back, and I swear to God, it looked like my head was digitally superimposed onto someone else's body. I was like \"This cannot be me - that's the way I look?\" It was so fucking surreal, 'cause as a kid I only fantasized about looking that way. Remember Soloflex commercials?

What the heck kind of gift is that? I mean, it's nice, but I'll never drive it. But I tell you, I cannot stop riding that Vespa. I dream about it when I'm away.

I'd put myself on tape at home for all these roles because they were like \"Oh, no, no. Bradley. He's such a good guy. He can't play that.\" Then it was 'David Dobkin' (qv), I went in for him on _Wedding Crashers (2005)_ (qv) and he had no idea what 'Alias' was or anything.

Thank you for saying that. Not the case, I gotta say, but it certainly provided more opportunities. Everybody who was a part of that movie, because it was so financially lucrative, benefited from it but I still put myself on tape for movies and try to get roles. It's the same, you know? It's the same.

I eat a lot of food. I am a big eater.", "[on the characters in _Silver Linings Playbook (2012)_ (qv)] The fact that these guys are trying to adopt a positive attitude was really important to me.

That high-octane rhythm demands that you stay in the moment and get out of your head. It's the only way you can be successful as an athlete. That's very scary for an actor.", "[2012, on quitting drinking at age 29] I was at a party and deliberately bashed my head on the concrete floor. Like \"Hey, look how tough I am!\" I did it again. I spent the night at St. Vincent's Hospital with a sock of ice, waiting for them to stitch me up... I don't drink or do drugs anymore. Being sober helps a great deal... I remember looking at my life, my apartment, my dogs [when I was still using], and I thought, \"What's happening?\" I was so concerned what [people] thought of me, how I was coming across, how I would survive the day.
