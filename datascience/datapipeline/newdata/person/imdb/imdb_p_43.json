He is of Scottish, Northern Irish, and English descent. During his early childhood, his parents moved with Ian and his sister Jean to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theater, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by 'William Shakespeare' (qv), in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian's growing passion for theatre.When Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\". Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theater festivals, where he saw the greats perform: 'Laurence Olivier' (qv), 'Wendy Hiller' (qv), 'John Gielgud' (qv), 'Ralph Richardson' (qv) and 'Paul Robeson' (qv). He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest.McKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian's homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing 'Margaret Thatcher' (qv)'s \"Section 28\" legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offense. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand. He has been active in the gay rights movement ever since.Ian resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner 'Sean Mathias' (qv). The two men have also worked together on the film _Bent (1997)_ (qv) as well as in exquisite stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theater, and was knighted by 'Queen Elizabeth II' (qv) in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare's works including his well received _Richard III (1995)_ (qv), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, _Cold Comfort Farm (1995)_ (qv), _Apt Pupil (1998)_ (qv) and _Gods and Monsters (1998)_ (qv), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen's role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps on 'solidifying' his 'role' as 'Laurence Olivier' (qv)'s worthy 'successor' in the best sense too, such as _King Lear (2008)_ (qv) / _Great Performances: King Lear (2008)_ (qv) directed by 'Trevor Nunn' (qv) and in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included \"Peter Pan\" and 'No\u00ebl Coward' (qv)'s \"Present Laughter\", as well as 'Samuel Beckett' (qv)'s \"Waiting for Godot\" and 'Harold Pinter' (qv)'s \"No Man's Land\" (_National Theatre Live: No Man's Land (2016)_ (qv)), both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by 'Sean Mathias' (qv).McKellen found mainstream success with his performance as Magneto in _X-Men (2000)_ (qv) and its sequels. His largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy directed by 'Peter Jackson' (qv), which he reprised in \"The Hobbit\" trilogy. He also reprised the role of 'King Lear' with new artistic perspectives in _National Theatre Live: King Lear (2018)_ (qv) offering an invaluable mesmerizing experience as a natural force of stage - and screen - of infinite generosity through his unsurpassable interpretation of the titanically vulnerable king.::Peacham and Markos."], "trade mark": ["Rich and flawless voice, combined with Shakespearean bearing.", "Distinctively calm style of speaking.", "Deep, blue eyes"], "trivia": ["He was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 1991 Queen's New Year Honours List for his services to drama.", "Has played the vampire in the music video \"Heart\" by 'Pet Shop Boys' (qv).", "Originated the role of 'Antonio Salieri' (qv) in the Broadway production of \"Amadeus\".", "Had a tattoo of the Elvish character for 9 along with seven other members of the fellowship in _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)_ (qv).", "Was offered the part of Mission Commander Swanbeck in _Mission: Impossible II (2000)_ (qv).
