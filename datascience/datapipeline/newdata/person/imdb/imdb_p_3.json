I think it's hard for actors to date each other because they are so damn moody. You are away from people constantly and having a relationship that is strictly by phone, it is miserable. Or if you say to him/her, \"Hey, (even though) I am doing a very sexy scene with this very sexy girl/boy, I love you and I'm going to be thinking of you when I am rolling around in bed with this person!\".", "We are supposed to be liberated in America but if our President had his way, we wouldn't be educated about sex at all. Every woman would have six children and we wouldn't be able to have abortions.", "Whose life would I like to step into for the day? The president's. I could probably get some things done in the Oval Office.", "Do I ever get nervous about this, right now, being the pinnacle of my career? Yeah, I do. At the end of (filming) every movie I think, \"Wow - this is the last one! Nice working with you.\".", "[on 'Woody Allen' (qv)] I just adore Woody. We have a lot in common. We're New Yorkers, Jewish. We have a very easygoing relationship.", "[on getting to entertain US troops in the Persian Gulf in 2008] This USO tour to the Gulf region truly means a lot. I've wanted to go over and visit for some time, and now my moment has arrived. It's one thing to reply to a letter or extend your thanks to service members in a speech, but it's another thing to visit them and spend time with those that do so much for us back home.", "[on comparisons with 'Marilyn Monroe' (qv)] I love Marilyn. I think she was incredibly beautiful and a very underrated actress. I am a curvy woman who is blonde, and perhaps we are both comfortable in our femininity, but I think that is as far as the comparison goes.", "My natural hair color is dirty blonde. I've been a bottle blonde before, very yellow - and a white blonde. My dad is Danish and he's a natural blonde. I've even taken a clipping from his hair to the salon so I can have it tinted the same color!", "[on 'Katy Perry' (qv)'s song, \"I Kissed a Girl\", which was inspired by 'Scarlett Johansson' (qv)] That's flattering, but my lips are kind of taken.", "[on her trip to Rwanda and initiative to help fight against AIDS in Africa] It was important for me to come here and see the issues we're up against firsthand. I came here with an open mind, wanting to listen, understand and learn; I leave with the overwhelming understanding that the small action of making a (RED) choice in your purchases... has an enormous impact on the lives of people in countries like Rwanda.", "I read a lot of things about myself that aren't true... I've read that I've been with people I've never met. It's not nice to have any attachment, but likewise, it's nice to have a boyfriend. I'm open to that. But it's hard, when you're working constantly, to spend enough time with someone.", "There was this rumor mill cranking out stories that I had lost 14 pounds - I could never lose 14 pounds. I can't look at somebody who is 6 feet tall and 120 pounds and say, I'm going to get that body. That's just never going to happen. You have to work with what you've got.", "[on her marriage to 'Ryan Reynolds' (qv)] I never really thought about getting married - it just kind of happened. It seemed natural, the right thing to do. It was kind of a celebration of the time... I'm kind of making my own little family now, which is funny. It's like a little bit of a tribe. You hope that a relationship makes you better, that you learn things about yourself.", "I would love to work on Broadway, but I don't know that it would manifest itself in musical theater... I have terrible stage fright that I'd have to get over. It came on when I was a teenager, and I think it somehow sticks with you. There are plenty of moments on stage where you think, \"If one of my boobs just fell out right now...\"", "I love to get ready for the red carpet, but being on it is very uncomfortable. It's so freakish and weird. I get flop sweats, dry mouth, heart palpitations, all-over panic!", "I try to stay fit and eat healthily, but I am not anxious to starve myself and become unnaturally thin. I don't find that look attractive on women and I don't want to become part of that trend. It's unhealthy and it puts too much pressure on women in general who are being fed this image of the ideal, which it is not. I think America has become obsessed with dieting rather than focusing on eating well, exercising and living a healthy life. I also think that being ultra-thin is not sexy at all. Women shouldn't be forced to conform to unrealistic and unhealthy body images that the media promote. I don't need to be skinny to be sexy.", "[on winning a Tony Award] Being welcomed into this community has been a dream come true for me. Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to be on Broadway, and here I am.", "[on working on Broadway] It was strange to think that this show is going to go on whether it's good or bad. They will let the audience in at some point, and they will see it, and we are going to be exposed for better or for worse.", "[on how she spends her free time] I'm still trying to figure out what to do when I'm not making movies. I just don't do that many things.", "[on being the face of Moet & Chandon Champagne] I am honored to have been chosen as their ambassador and to make history with the brand, as the first celebrity face of champagne.", "[on her 2011 photo shoot for Mango clothing] Yes, it has been great working with Mango. I loved working with the whole team - I think between Mario, the makeup and hairdressing teams and the stylist, we have created something special.", "Sharing food is one of life's pleasures. On a global scale, we don't share fairly. Close to a billion people go to bed hungry every night. The fact is: the global food system is a broken one. All of us, from Kentucky to Kenya, deserve enough to eat. That's why I'm joining Oxfam's Grow campaign.", "I'm curvy - I'm never going to be 5' 11' and 120 pounds. But I feel lucky to have what I've got. I feel comfortable as a young woman - a young, modern, liberal person. I feel comfortable with my sexuality. However, I am protective of my private life. I don't think that if you are in the public eye, your life is public. I am an actor. But you can't take things too seriously.", "I don't feel mature. I always feel about the age I am. I know 'Robert Redford' (qv) described me as, '13 going on 30', but that's not how I felt at the time. I am still dorky. I watch cheesy television with TV dinners and, at one point, could not stop watching 'Jerry Springer' (qv).", "I started acting when I was seven. I had a couple of lines in this play called \"Sophistry\" with 'Ethan Hawke' (qv). I studied at the 'Lee Strasberg' (qv) Institute, and that really gave me an opportunity to perform before live audiences. There's absolutely a difference between that and working in film... like you can mess up in film and not worry about it.", "[on the alleged nude photos of her which were stolen by hackers] Just because you're in the spotlight, or just because you're an actor or making films or whatever, doesn't mean that you're not entitled to your own personal privacy. I think no matter what the context, if that is besieged in some way, it feels unjust. It feels wrong.", "[on her divorce in 2011] At first, I was quite depressed. After about a week or so, I pulled myself together and started to go to the gym all the time. Luckily, I've got a few very close girlfriends who have been by my side for 15 years now, whom I can talk to about everything and confide in. I have a close relationship with my twin brother Hunter as well. And then there's my grandmother Dorothy. She's an incredibly sweet, lovely and wise woman.", "I don't have a Facebook or a Twitter account, and I don't know how I feel about this idea of, \"Now, I'm eating dinner, and I want everyone to know that I'm having dinner at this time,\" or \"I just mailed a letter and dropped off my kids.\" That, to me, is a very strange phenomenon. I can't think of anything I'd rather do less than have to continuously share details of my everyday life. I guess they [celebrities] use it in a way that works for them. But I'd rather that people had less access to my personal life. If I could keep it that way, I'd be a happy lady.", "There's a lot of things that I want to pursue and hopefully, eventually will when all of this falls apart. I work with a lot of nongovernmental organizations. I don't know if I'd want to start my own, but I think I'd dedicate more of my time to that. It'd also be nice to have a vineyard somewhere, an organic farm or something like that. That's like a hippie-dippy wish - but a really good one.", "One of the most exciting thing about _The Avengers (2012)_ (qv), is that in my opening scene the first thing you see is my character getting punched in the face. Everybody's like \"Damn, it's nice to see a girl get the shit kicked out of her.\".", "Unfortunately, my generation had a shitty time. Horrible bubblegum pop boy bands and rap metal. It just wasn't my scene. There was some good hip hop, though, like 'Fugees' (qv).", "When I was 13, I loved 'Radiohead' (qv)'s The Bends and I loved 'Nine Inch Nails' (qv). When I graduated to a CD player, I'd listen to a lot of old 'Depeche Mode' (qv) and 'New Order' (qv), actually. I'd start rummaging through what my older brother had and discover all this weird progressive new wave music that he'd been listening to 10 years prior.", "The first time I had a really private experience with an album was when I was 10 and somebody gave me an Abbey Road cassette tape as a Christmas stocking stuffer. I knew that goddamn tape backwards and forwards. I had one of those Walkmans that you didn't have to flip over. It had auto reverse and would just play over and over.", "I wanted to be 'Frank Sinatra' (qv) and sing like him. He's got a voice like gold bullion. His voice is like velvet cake. I loved all the Vegas stuff, but I liked the polka dot and moonbeams stuff best. Early Frank, when he was just \"Frankie\", a whisper of what he would someday be. I was a ham as a kid. I loved musical theater, so from a young age, I admired how show-stopping Sinatra was.", "My parents' music became my music.", "One of my favorite Waits ('Tom Waits' (qv)) songs is \"Burma Shave\". We tried to do that... and couldn't. I asked myself, \"What is the essence of this song?\" and I realized that I couldn't do it because it's Tom. Tom is the essence.", "A song like \"Who You Are\" is such a personal thing for 'Tom Waits' (qv). I can't even pretend to imagine what it was born out of. I would never try to interpret somebody else's emotion. I can only read the lyrics and associate them with my own life experience. I had to sing them from my own gut. The same way you would take somebody's written dialogue and breathe your own life into it. I have the perspective that I have and I can only work through that.", "I grew up in a household that was very politically conscious... it was just understood that it was important, that it was our responsibility.", "My brother was totally geeked-out by 'Katie Couric' (qv). I think he followed her around the entire night. I was chasing after him, and I turned around, and I had a bunch of Republican senators chasing after me.", "I think I understand my emotional state and my complexities now in a much clearer way, and I can put them to rest in a way that there's almost a catharsis that happens through the work, where I can do it and then find myself again.", "[on being thought of as a sex symbol] Are you asking me if I feel objectified? I think that, sure, I've been a 'victim' of that, if you want to call it that, but only as much as anyone else. I don't feel particularly singled out more than any other person. All you have to do is go to a nightclub to see that happening every day. A man is not always trying to undress a woman's brain first.", "[on varying the roles she accepts] It would be such a waste to just continue to do the same thing and not take a risk. I don't have anything to lose, really. Even if it doesn't work out, the gain if it does is so much greater. Taking those risks is something I feel more and more comfortable with.", "I just didn't think that I would be able to stay in that kind of twisted frenzy that a lot of actors feel they need in order to work.", "I was always terrible at commercials because my voice was so deep. At the age of 9, I sounded like a whiskey-drinking, chain-smoking fool.", "With _Her (2013)_ (qv), it was about finding the shape of things and building this character that's almost a babe - but just fresh out of the package in every way.", "'Jonathan Glazer' (qv) is such a sensitive, engaged, funny person. But then you see the film and you're like \"Jesus, is that what's in his mind all the time?\".", "I associate [ScarJo] with, like, pop stars. It sounds tacky. It's lazy and flippant... And there's something kind of violent about it. There's something insulting about it.", "[on her role as Natasha Romanoff] Well you know, I don't think I have never really seen a film of this genre, where the female characters' sex appeal sort of came second. I mean of course they're sexy characters. When you have a sexy secretary, or a girl swinging around by her ankles in a catsuit, you know that's innately sexy, but the fact is that these characters are intelligent. They're ambitious. They're motivated and calculated to some degree.", "I wouldn't say I'm a particular sci-fi fan. I mean, I guess I like some sci-fi movies, but I think it's sort of a trend that reflects the time that we're living in, the question of identity, [...] as we kind of advance in this digital age and how it affects our own identity.", "[on backing out to portray Dante \"Tex\" Gill for the canceled Rub & Tug film] While I would have loved the opportunity to bring Dante's story and transition to life, I understand why many feel he should be portrayed by a transgender person, and I am thankful that this casting debate, albeit controversial, has sparked a larger conversation about diversity and representation in film. I have great admiration and love for the trans community and am grateful that the conversation regarding inclusivity in Hollywood continues."], "salary history": ["_Iron Man 2 (2010)_ (qv)::$400,000", "_The Avengers (2012)_ (qv)::$6,000,000", "_Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)_ (qv)::$20,000,000", "_Ghost in the Shell (2017)_ (qv)::$10,000,000", "_Avengers: Endgame (2019)_ (qv)::$35,000,000 back-end payment", "_Black Widow (2020)_ (qv)::$20,000,000 +back end"], "birth date": "1984-11-22", "birth notes": "New York City, New York, USA", "_actorID": "3", "_source": "IMDB", "actorID": "0424060", "created_utc_dt": "09/14/2019, 13:01:13"}
