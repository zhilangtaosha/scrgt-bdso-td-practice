He had a comfortable, middle-class upbringing in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. Eastwood's parents relocated to Washington state in 1949, and Clint worked menial jobs in the Pacific Northwest until returning to California for a stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation. He enrolled at Los Angeles City College, but dropped out after two semesters to pursue acting. During the mid-'50s he found uncredited bit parts in such B-films as _Revenge of the Creature (1955)_ (qv) and _Tarantula (1955)_ (qv) while simultaneously digging swimming pools to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show _Rawhide (1959)_ (qv) with 'Eric Fleming' (qv). Though only a secondary player for the first seven seasons, Clint was promoted to series star when Fleming departed in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.Eastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in 'Sergio Leone' (qv)'s trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: _A Fistful of Dollars (1964)_ (qv), _For a Few Dollars More (1965)_ (qv), and _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)_ (qv). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with 'Enrico Maria Salerno' (qv) providing the voice for Clint's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967. As the last film racked up phenomenal grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from undistinguished TV actor to sought-after box office attraction in just a matter of months. Yet again a success was the late-blooming star's first U.S.-made western, _Hang 'Em High (1968)_ (qv). He followed that up with the lead role in _Coogan's Bluff (1968)_ (qv) (the loose inspiration for the TV series _McCloud (1970)_ (qv)), before playing second fiddle to 'Richard Burton' (qv) in the World War II epic _Where Eagles Dare (1968)_ (qv) and 'Lee Marvin' (qv) in the bizarre musical _Paint Your Wagon (1969)_ (qv). In _Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970)_ (qv) and _Kelly's Heroes (1970)_ (qv), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a predatory Union soldier in _The Beguiled (1971)_ (qv) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller _Play Misty for Me (1971)_ (qv). His role as the hard edge police inspector in _Dirty Harry (1971)_ (qv), meanwhile, gave him cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Thereafter, Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies: the westerns _Joe Kidd (1972)_ (qv), _High Plains Drifter (1973)_ (qv) and _The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)_ (qv) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love 'Sondra Locke' (qv)), the Dirty Harry sequels _Magnum Force (1973)_ (qv) and _The Enforcer (1976)_ (qv), the road adventures _Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974)_ (qv) and _The Gauntlet (1977)_ (qv), and the fact-based prison film _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with _Every Which Way but Loose (1978)_ (qv), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, _The Eiger Sanction (1975)_ (qv) notwithstanding, the '70s were an uninterrupted success for Clint.Eastwood kicked off the '80s with _Any Which Way You Can (1980)_ (qv), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, _Sudden Impact (1983)_ (qv), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase, \"Make my day.\" Clint also starred in _Bronco Billy (1980)_ (qv), _Firefox (1982)_ (qv), _Tightrope (1984)_ (qv), _City Heat (1984)_ (qv), _Pale Rider (1985)_ (qv) and _Heartbreak Ridge (1986)_ (qv), all of which were solid hits, with _Honkytonk Man (1982)_ (qv) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988 he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, _The Dead Pool (1988)_ (qv). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs _Pink Cadillac (1989)_ (qv) and _The Rookie (1990)_ (qv), it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before. He started taking on low-key projects, directing _Bird (1988)_ (qv), a biopic of 'Charlie Parker' (qv) that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing _White Hunter Black Heart (1990)_ (qv), an uneven, loose biopic of 'John Huston' (qv). (Both films had a limited release.)Eastwood bounced back with his dark western _Unforgiven (1992)_ (qv), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in _In the Line of Fire (1993)_ (qv), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received _A Perfect World (1993)_ (qv) with 'Kevin Costner' (qv). Next up was a love story, _The Bridges of Madison County (1995)_ (qv), where Clint surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than 'Meryl Streep' (qv). But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. _Absolute Power (1997)_ (qv) and _Space Cowboys (2000)_ (qv) did well enough, while _True Crime (1999)_ (qv) and _Blood Work (2002)_ (qv) were received badly, as was _Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997)_ (qv), which he directed but didn't appear in.Eastwood surprised yet again in 2005, when he returned to the top of the A-list with _Million Dollar Baby (2004)_ (qv). Also starring 'Hilary Swank' (qv) and 'Morgan Freeman' (qv), the hugely successful drama won four Academy 'Awards' (qv), including Best Picture and Best Director for Clint. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. Eastwood's next starring vehicle, _Gran Torino (2008)_ (qv), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, _Trouble with the Curve (2012)_ (qv), as well as a reality show, _Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012)_ (qv). Between screen appearances, Clint chalked up an impressive list of additional credits behind the camera. He directed _Mystic River (2003)_ (qv) (in which 'Sean Penn' (qv) and 'Tim Robbins' (qv) gave Oscar-winning performances), _Flags of our Fathers (2006)_ (qv), _Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)_ (qv) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), _Changeling (2008)_ (qv) (a vehicle for screen megastar 'Angelina Jolie' (qv)), _Invictus (2009)_ (qv) (again with Freeman), _Hereafter (2010)_ (qv), _J. Edgar (2011)_ (qv), _Jersey Boys (2014)_ (qv), _American Sniper (2014)_ (qv) (2014's top box office champ), _Sully (2016)_ (qv) (starring 'Tom Hanks' (qv) as hero pilot 'Chesley Sullenberger' (qv)) and _The 15:17 to Paris (2018)_ (qv) (based on the thwarted Thalys train attack of 2015). His latest project, in which he stars as an unlikely drug courier, is _The Mule (2018)_ (qv).Eastwood's individuality outside of work has been extremely convoluted, to put it mildly. He managed to keep his personal life top secret for the first three decades of his celebrity. (To this day the Hollywood kingpin refuses to disclose exactly how many families he's started.) He had a long time relationship with frequent '70s/'80s co-star Locke, who published a scathing memoir in 1997, and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women. He has only been married twice, however -- with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.

Locke described Eastwood as \"a monster who thought nothing of destroying anything inconvenient to him\" and likened the actor to 'O.J. Simpson' (qv). \"Others who knew Clint said that I had been 'far too kind' to him,\" she said of this evisceration. (Neither Eastwood or his publicist, 'Joe Hyams' (qv), would comment.) Locke reiterated previous testimony that Eastwood had manipulated her into having two abortions and sterilizing herself in the 1970s and sabotaged her directorial career after their 1989 split. But she also made a new allegation that he sired another woman's two children during the last three years of their relationship. The allegation of secret children was not even acknowledged by mainstream media, despite the fact that Locke's book exposed the kids' names and exact birthdates. Published reviews misrepresented the book by omitting its serious accusations and emphasizing trivial tidbits instead. (One anecdote widely printed in lieu of anything relevant was Eastwood's habit of asking \"Sweetie, did you floss?\" before they made love.) Locke learned of Eastwood's double life, she wrote, when an investigative journalist phoned her during depositions in the palimony case. The extraordinary revelation -- that Eastwood had a hidden family in Carmel, residing in a house under his business manager Roy Kaufman's name -- was confirmed in closed court after Locke filed a motion to discover and Eastwood's will was called in for evidence, with the document showing one Jacelyn Reeves and Reeves' legally fatherless son and daughter listed as beneficiaries.", "In April 1989, 'Sondra Locke' (qv) filed a $70 million palimony lawsuit against Clint, after he changed the locks on their Bel-Air home and moved her possessions into storage while she was at work on the _Impulse (1990)_ (qv) set. The relationship had been on the rocks for months, with Clint leaving nonverbal hints that he wanted Sondra to get out of his life voluntarily (once, while she was still in the shower, he left to go to a party to which they'd both been invited), but they weren't officially broken up. During the 15 days between the lockout and Sondra filing suit, she tried to resolve things quietly, but Clint offered her nothing and would only communicate via lawyers. (To Sondra, an equal division of assets was principle rather than greed. She had actually saved up $3 million over the course of her 14-year relationship with Clint because he was paying all their expenses.) Clint refused to say Sondra's name out loud at his depositions, reducing her to pronouns or alternately referring to her as \"the person.\" He also never made eye contact or any reference to her proximity in the courtroom. Sondra said the stress of the ordeal induced breast cancer, requiring mastectomies. In November 1990, 19 months into proceedings, she arranged to meet with Clint in private and achieved an immediate settlement. Sondra received $450,000 lump sum plus monthly support payments, title to a house in West Hollywood that Clint had been leasing to her lawful wedded but openly gay husband 'Gordon Anderson' (qv), and a $1.5 million multi-year contract with Warner Bros. to develop and direct films. By 1994, however, the studio had yet to provide Sondra with a single directorial assignment and rejected over 30 projects she submitted. Sondra became convinced the deal was a sham and that she was employed only on paper. \"I was stunned and outraged at how I had been tricked and cheated\" she said. (Her attorney, Peggy Garrity, would later claim Clint held out the Warner deal like a \"dangled carrot\" to get her to drop the palimony suit.) Sondra sued Clint again for fraud in June 1995, having unearthed a bookkeeping printout to corroborate the charge. She asserted that the money WB pretended they were paying her came from Clint's own pocket and had been laundered through the operating budget for _Unforgiven (1992)_ (qv). The case went to trial in September 1996; one juror disclosed that the panel agreed to find for Sondra by a 10-to-2 vote (nine votes are needed for a verdict) and were only debating the amount. Clint's legal team convinced him to settle at the eleventh hour, and on the morning jurors were set to begin a second day of deliberation, Sondra announced her decision to drop her suit against Clint in return for an unspecified monetary reward. As Clint walked down the courthouse steps, he told a bank of cameras, \"What does this say to young women across the country who work very hard for a living?\" (A nonsensical remark, since the case he had just lost was all about work--work he had obstructed his ex-soulmate from doing.) Sondra then brought separate action against Warner Brothers, seeking $100 million in damages for conspiring with Clint to ruin her career. It was settled out of court in May 1999, ending the decade-long legal saga. While she was bound by confidentiality not to reveal the amount, Locke wasn't shy about disclosing her feelings. \"I feel elated.

On the other hand, it was Reynolds who sent Clint a copy of \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\", later made into a film by Eastwood (_The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)_ (qv)).

In Les grands reportages: L'album secret de 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) (2013), McGilligan stated on camera: \"We don't know how many children Clint has had.\" Besides Ms. Murray, since at least 2005 there is a rumor of unknown origin that Eastwood fathered a son named Lesly born on 13 February 1959 to one Rosina Mary Glen.

What it does say about his life, while approved by Clint, doesn't sit well with everyone. 'Sondra Locke' (qv) denounced Schickel's book as a \"puff piece\" and said it was \"full of misstatements and downright fabrication, not only about me but others.\" Schickel, who also provided audio commentary for Eastwood films on DVD, passed away in 2017.

I had publicly exposed him,\" she commented in retrospect.) The breakup with Locke opened the floodgates to investigative journalism about Eastwood. In July 1989, the National Enquirer reported the existence of a love child he fathered in 1964, and in February 1990, the Star tabloid became the first publication to link Eastwood's name with Jacelyn Reeves--who, it turns out, was the mother of two of his unmentionable offspring. Reputable news outlets wouldn't touch this information for years after. Almost certainly, his career would have suffered had this become public knowledge during the fact. Almost certainly, knowledge of this (and other out-of-wedlock children) would have hampered his 1986 mayoral campaign. When Locke's memoirs were published in 1997, she was shut out of most venues to promote the book. \"Sadly, it was well suppressed by Clint and WB. [...] I was sad that it did not get the attention I feel it deserved,\" she said in 2013. \"Clint: The Life and Legend,\" a deeply unflattering biography by film historian 'Patrick McGilligan' (qv), was published in Great Britain in 1999, but did not make its way to the United States until 2002, having bounced around publishers for three years amid rumored threats from Eastwood's attorneys. Los Angeles Times critic 'Allen Barra' (qv) called it \"perhaps the most thoroughly demythologizing book yet written on modern Hollywood.\" On Christmas Eve 2002, Eastwood's lawyer 'Marshall Grossman' (qv) filed a $10 million libel suit against McGilligan and St. Martin's Press in San Jose, California. Strangely enough, out of all the sordid stories in the book, the libel claim only covered three points, according to news reports: (1) That Eastwood once punched his first wife Maggie Johnson in the face; (2) That Eastwood is an atheist; (3) That Eastwood used a romantic relationship with an officer's daughter in order to avoid being sent overseas during the Korean conflict. The suit was settled in July 2004 without any public disclosure; McGilligan and the publisher admitted no wrongdoing and there was no penalty. A revised and updated version of \"Clint\" was published in 2015, with most of the original content intact. The three cited passages had been excised, and a few other modifications amounting to less than two pages were made. McGilligan says many of things he reported in the first edition are now taken for granted, and one of the reasons Eastwood sued him was an obvious attempt to find out his sources.", "Net worth was estimated at $375 million prior to his 2014 divorce from 'Dina Eastwood' (qv).

Eastwood sat up in bed one night reading the new draft, while Locke sat next to him, watching him warily. Yet he seemed to be enjoying it, laughing as he read and scribbling in the margins. The next day, Locke arrived at Malpaso offices first and told credited producer 'Fritz Manes' (qv) not to worry, Clint loved the changes. Eastwood came in the door about noontime because he never came in early. According to Manes, \"He was purple...I've never seen him so f***ing mad. He takes this thing and he throws it so hard it almost broke the window behind me. He said, 'I'm closing this thing down. How could you let her do this?'. I said, 'I thought you knew.' He said, 'Well, you don't have to worry about this piece of s*** anymore. I'm going out and telling Warners to shut the production down.'\" Clint went to the outer office and grabbed Sondra and they went off somewhere and had a huge explosion. Manes went over to the floor and picked up the script. \"It had F*** - C***SUCKER - S*** - across every page,\" said Manes. \"Every page had some awful thing on it like some lunatic had scribbled all over it!\" Production ultimately went ahead, but Locke had to abandon Anderson's script and all the new characters and details he had created. Sondra cites the _Ratboy (1986)_ (qv) debacle as \"the beginning of the end\" of her relationship with Clint, and declared in hindsight that \"obviously whatever control issues he had over my directing were fueled by the hidden birth of a son.\" (Although she didn't know it at the time, Eastwood was cheating on her and had just become the father of Scott Clinton Reeves, born more than 300 miles away to a stewardess in Monterey.).", "While promoting the reality series _Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012)_ (qv) on E!, Clint's then-wife 'Dina Eastwood' (qv) told 'Chelsea Handler' (qv): \"I hope we're still married when this is over!\".

And that well-oiled machine is the crew -- the cast, of course, you've met a lot of them. But there's still Margo and Anthony and Michael and Mike and Jay and everybody else who was so fabulous in this cast. And the crew, Campanelli. 'Billy Coe' (qv) and, of course, 'Tom Stern' (qv), who is fantastic. And 'Henry Bumstead' (qv), the great 'Henry Bumstead' (qv) who is the head of our crack geriatrics team. And Henry and Jack Taylor, and Dick Goddard ['Richard C. Goddard' (qv)], all those guys. Walt and everybody. I can't think of everybody right now.I'm drawing a blank right now. But, Warren, you were right. And thank you, for your confidence earlier in the evening. I'm just lucky to be here. Lucky to be still working. And I watched 'Sidney Lumet' (qv), who is 80, and I figure, \"I'm just a kid. I'll just -- I've got a lot of stuff to do yet.\" So thank you all very much.

He's sort of a lost soul in mid-America. I've been that guy.", "I think people jumped to conclusions about _Dirty Harry (1971)_ (qv) without giving the character much thought, trying to attach right-wing connotations to the film that were never really intended. Both the director ['Don Siegel' (qv)] and I thought it was a basic kind of drama - what do you do when you believe so much in law and order and coming to the rescue of people and you just have five hours to solve a case? That kind of impossible effort was fun to portray, but I think it was interpreted as a pro-police point of view, as a kind of rightist heroism, at a time in American history when police officers were looked down on as \"pigs\", as very oppressive people - I'm sure there are some who are, and a lot who aren't. I've met both kinds.", "You have to trust your instincts. There's a moment when an actor has it, and he knows it. Behind the camera you can feel the moment even more clearly. And once you've got it, once you feel it, you can't second-guess yourself. You can find a million reasons why something didn't work. But if it feels right, and it looks right, it works. Without sounding like a pseudointellectual dipshit, it's my responsibility to be true to myself. If it works for me, it's right.", "None of the pictures I take a risk in cost a lot, so it doesn't take much for them to turn a profit. We don't deal in big budgets. We know what we want and we shoot it and we don't waste anything. I never understand these films that cost twenty, thirty million dollars when they could be made for half that. Maybe it's because no one cares. We care.", "[on how he decided to do _A Fistful of Dollars (1964)_ (qv)] I'd done _Rawhide (1959)_ (qv) for about five years. The agency called and asked if I was interested in doing a western in Italy and Spain. I said, \"Not particularly.\" They said, \"Why don't you give the script a quick look?\" Well, I was kind of curious, so I read it, and I recognized it right away as _Yojimbo (1961)_ (qv), a Kurosawa ['Akira Kurosawa' (qv)] film I had liked a lot.

A hero from World War II, a charismatic individual, a military man, a non-attorney - even then I liked that! I was a very young person voting for the first time. A lot of people joke that a conservative is a liberal who's made his first $100,000 and then decides,\"Wait a second, I want to save this, why are they taxing it away?\". Today the country's in kind of a turmoil over taxing. Being raised in the thirties, watching my parents work hard to make ends meet, with jobs scarce, and then the war years - it tends to make a person a little more fiscally conscious than if you've been born into a wealthier family.

I think California has always had a mandatory waiting period, so we were never concerned about it like the rest of the country. Some states didn't have any at all. So I've always supported that. I think it's very important that guns don't get in the wrong hands, and, yes, I would support most of that. I don't know too much about trigger locks. I've never really discussed that with anyone. But I do feel that guns - it's very important to keep them out of the hands of felons or anyone who might be crazy with it.", "I've thought about retiring for years now. When I did _Play Misty for Me (1971)_ (qv) in 1970, I thought that if I could pull this off maybe I could step behind the camera, and it would be time to see the end of me.

My recent efforts, like _The Bridges of Madison County (1995)_ (qv), weren't too violent. In recent years I've done less, and, yes, I am concerned about violence in film. In '92, when I did _Unforgiven (1992)_ (qv), which is a film that had a very anti- violence and anti-gun play - anti-romanticizing of gun play theme, I remember that 'Gene Hackman' (qv) was concerned about it, and we both discussed the issue of too much violence in films.

Eisenhower' (qv) was running. And I was in the military. I was a fan of his. And that's how I got started off. I was never - my parents were mixed, I think one Republican, one Democrat, so I didn't have any grand-pappies to influence me.", "When I was doing _The Bridges of Madison County (1995)_ (qv), I said to myself, \"This romantic stuff is really tough.

These people are always bitching about \"Hollyweird\", and then they start bitching about this film. Are they all so mad because _The Passion of the Christ (2004)_ (qv) is only up for the makeup award and a couple of other minor things? Extremism is so easy. You've got your position, and that's it. It doesn't take much thought. And when you go far enough to the right you meet the same idiots coming around from the left.", "[on 'John Huston' (qv)] It's another aspect of the character that pleased me: he was interested in other things besides his art. He liked women, gambling, living the high life. He could have a life parallel to his work. I could identify with this type of behavior. But, because of this very fact, he became attracted more and more by other things, so that what interested him in life moved him away from his art to the point that he nearly lived a tragedy. And the tragedy brings him back to reality. If you study Huston's life, you realize that at the age of nineteen he thought he didn't have long to live because of a heart defect a doctor has notified him of as a result of a misdiagnosis. It drove him to elaborate a personal philosophy according to which he would profit from life to the maximum. He didn't take care of himself - he was a confirmed smoker, a heavy drinker - and yet he lived to be more than eighty. 'Paul Newman' (qv) spoke to me about him when we were acting at the same time, each in a different movie, in Tucson, Arizona. He was starring in _The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972)_ (qv) and I was doing _Joe Kidd (1972)_ (qv) with 'John Sturges' (qv). Huston drank martinis and smoked cigars all night long, slept from one o'clock to four o'clock in the morning because he was an insomniac, did everything he shouldn't do to live to be old, and yet he died at a very great age! It was the same thing with 'John Wayne' (qv), who was first of all the opposite of a health fanatic.", "I never considered myself a cowboy, because I wasn't.

Patton' (qv)], of course, and maybe ['Dwight D. Eisenhower' (qv)], who was the head of the Allied forces. And 'Gary Cooper' (qv). There were just a handful of men and a handful of women. Now, people become stars who are just heiresses or something.", "I also wonder how I got this far in life. Growing up, I never knew what I wanted to do. I was not a terribly good student or a very vivacious, outgoing person. I was just kind of a backward kid. I grew up in various little towns and ended up in Oakland, California, going to a trade school. I didn't want to be an actor, because I thought an actor had to be an extrovert - somebody who loved to tell jokes and talk and be a raconteur. And I was something of an introvert. My mother used to say: \"You have a little angel on your shoulder.\" I guess she was surprised I grew up at all, never mind that I got to where I am. The best I can do is quote a line from _Unforgiven (1992)_ (qv): \"Deserve's got nothing to do with it.\"", "Every movie I make teaches me something, and that's why I keep making them. I'm at that stage of life when I could probably stop and just hit golf balls. But in filming these two movies about Iwo Jima, I learnt about war and about character. I also learnt a lot about myself.", "I was a teenager when the battle of Iwo Jima took place. I remember hearing about the bond drive and the need to maintain the war effort. Back then, people had just come through 10 years of a Depression, and they were used to working for everything. I still have an image of someone coming to our house when I was about six years old, offering to cut and stack the wood in our back yard if my mother would make him a sandwich.", "The Americans who went to Iwo Jima knew it would be a tough fight, but they always believed they'd win. The Japanese were told they wouldn't come home - they were being sent to die for the Emperor. People have made a lot out of that very different cultural approach. But as I got into the storytelling for the two movies [_Flags of our Fathers (2006)_ (qv) and _Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)_ (qv)], I realised that the 19-year-olds from both sides had the same fears. They all wrote poignant letters home saying: \"I don't want to die.\" They were all going through the same thing, despite the cultural differences.", "I guess if you see both of the movies [_Flags of our Fathers (2006)_ (qv) and _Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)_ (qv)] together, they sum up as an antiwar film. Whether it's about territory or religion, war is horrifyingly and depressingly archaic. But I didn't set out to make a war movie. I cared about those three fellows - Bradley, Hayes and Gagnon ['John H. Bradley' (qv), 'Ira H. Hayes' (qv), 'Rene A. Gagnon' (qv)] - the headliners on that war-bond circus. The young men were taken off the front lines, wined and dined, introduced to movie stars. But it felt wrong to them.", "As for me, I like being behind the camera instead of in front of it. I can wear what I want. Will I act again? I never say never. I like doing things where I can stretch and go in different directions. I'm not looking to take it easy. Like the Marines on Iwo Jima, I understand that if you really want something, you have to be ready to fight.", "Life is a constant class, and once you think you know it all, you're due to decay. You're due to slide. I have to keep challenging myself and try something I haven't done before. The studios aren't always happy with that. When I wanted to make _Mystic River (2003)_ (qv), the studio said, \"Uh-oh, it's so dark.\" And I said, \"Well, it's important. And it's a nice story.\" Then the next movie, _Million Dollar Baby (2004)_ (qv), they said, \"Who wants to see a picture about a girl boxing?\" And I said, \"It's really a father-daughter love story. Boxing just happens to be what's going on.\" They didn't have much faith. So there are always obstacles and people afraid to take risks. That's why you end up with remakes of old TV shows as movies. But playing it safe is what's risky, because nothing new comes out of it.", "[on the Iraq war] My druthers would have been, \"Get a more benevolent dictator and stick him in. You know, try somebody a little less mean.\" You don't go in there and fire the army. The army's got to do something. When you fire 'em, you leave them all unemployed. Worst thing in the world. Just get somebody else who they respect and bring him on your side. That's one way of doing it.", "[on President 'George W. Bush' (qv)] You've got to admire somebody who stands up for what they believe regardless of how the polls go. A lot of presidents do everything by the polls. They do a focus group then all of a sudden they say, \"OK, that's what I'm going to be for because that's where focus group is leading me.", "[on the Iraq war] I wasn't for going in there. Only because democracy isn't something that you get overnight. I don't think America got democracy overnight. It's something we had to fight for and believe in.", "[on 'John Wayne' (qv)] I gave him a piece of material that I thought had potential for us to do as a younger guy and an older guy. He wrote me back critical of it. He had seen _High Plains Drifter (1973)_ (qv), and he didn't think that represented Americana like _She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)_ (qv) and other 'John Ford' (qv) westerns. I never answered him.", "[on 'Sergio Leone' (qv)] I spun off Sergio and he spun off me. I think we worked well together. I like his compositions. He has a very good eye. I liked him, I liked his sense of humor, but I feel it was mutual. He liked dealing with the kind of character I was putting together.", "\"Macho\" was a fashionable word in the 1980s. Everybody was kind of into it, what's macho and what isn't macho. I really don't know what macho is. I never have understood. Does it mean somebody who swaggers around exuding testosterone? And kicks the gate open and runs sprints up and down the street? Or does handsprings or whatever? Or is macho a quiet thing based on your security. I remember shaking hands with 'Rocky Marciano' (qv). He was gentle, he didn't squeeze your hand. And he had a high voice. But he could knock people around, it was a given. That's macho. 'Muhammad Ali' (qv) is the same. If you talked with him in his younger years, he spoke gently. He wasn't kicking over chairs. I think some of the most macho people are the gentlest.", "I was tired of playing the nice, clean-cut cowboy in _Rawhide (1959)_ (qv), I wanted something earthier. Something different from the old-fashioned Western. You know: Hero rides in, very stalwart, with white hat, man's beating a horse, hero jumps off, punches man, schoolmarm walks down the street, sees this situation going on, slight conflict with schoolmarm, but not too much. You know schoolmarm and hero will be together in exactly 10 more reels, if you care to sit around and wait, and you know the man beast horse with eventually get comeuppance from hero this guy bushwhacks him in reel nine. But [_A Fistful of Dollars (1964)_ (qv)] was different; it definitely had satiric overtones. The hero was an enigmatic figure, and that worked within the context of this picture. In some films, he would be ludicrous. You can't have a cartoon in the middle of a Renoir.", "In those days, they'd make interview tests, not acting tests. They'd sit you in front of the camera and talk--just as we're talking now. I thought I was an absolute clod. It looked pretty good; it was photographed well, but I thought, \"If that's acting, I'm in trouble\". But they signed me up as a contract player--which was a little lower than working in the mailroom.", "I like working with actors who don't have anything to prove.", "[on _Ambush at Cimarron Pass (1958)_ (qv)] Probably the lousiest western ever made.", "[on the retirement of friend and fellow actor 'Gene Hackman' (qv)]: It is a sad thing. I know his agent and I saw him recently, and he said, 'Can't you talk Gene into coming back?' I said, 'I'd love to see him come back, but I think it's not very nice to ride him.' He's too good an actor not to be performing but, by the same token, he probably thinks that's enough.", "[on _Gran Torino (2008)_ (qv)] That will probably do it for me as far as acting is concerned. You always want to quit while you are ahead. You don't want to be like a fighter who stays too long in the ring until you're not performing at your best.", "There are certain things you have to be realistic about. Dirty Harry would not be on a police department at my age so we'll move on from that.", "Having a good person as a foil certainly helps, because acting is an ensemble art form.

They started out with a real dramatic story and then made it fluffy. When they changed it around, I tried to bail out. It wasn't my favorite. I wasn't particularly nervous about singing on film. My dad was a singer and we'd have sing-arounds. But certainly ['Frank Sinatra' (qv)] wasn't worried.", "With _Every Which Way but Loose (1978)_ (qv), they gave me the script and I thought, \"This is something. This is kinda crazy. But there's something kind of hip about it. This guy's out drifting along and his best friend is an orangutan\". I mean, the scenes of talking to an orangutan about your troubles, I'd never seen anything quite like it. He has a romance that falls through, he doesn't get the girl, and then he goes off with the orangutan. I thought, What could be better? I wouldn't put it in the time capsule of films you did that you thought were great, but everything's a challenge.", "'Gene Hackman' (qv) was interesting because I gave the _Unforgiven (1992)_ (qv) script to his agent and he said no, he didn't want to do anything violent. But I went back to him and said, \"I know where you're coming from. You get to a certain age and I'm there too, where you don't want to tell a lot of violent stories, but this is a chance to make a great statement\".", "At this particular time in my life, I'm not doing anything as a moneymaker. It's like I'm pushing the envelope the other way to see how far we can go to be noncommercial. But I'm definitely not going for the demographics of 13- to 15-year-olds. I didn't know if _Mystic River (2003)_ (qv) would go over at all. I had a hard time getting it financed, to tell you the truth. But I just told Warners the same thing I did with _Million Dollar Baby (2004)_ (qv): \"I don't know if this is going to make any money. But, I think I can make a picture that you'd be proud to have in your library.", "People have lost their sense of humor. In former times we constantly made jokes about different races. You can only tell them today with one hand over your mouth or you will be insulted as a racist. I find that ridiculous. In those earlier days every friendly clique had a 'Sam the Jew' or 'Jose the Mexican' - but we didn't think anything of it or have a racist thought. It was just normal that we made jokes based on our nationality or ethnicity. That was never a problem. I don't want to be politically correct. We're all spending too much time and energy trying to be politically correct about everything.", "[on the possibility of a _Dirty Harry (1971)_ (qv) sequel] I'm 78 years old, and you're pretty well drummed out of the police force by that age.

To me, she's like a throwback to the women in film of the Forties. Not to say women today aren't great, but back then there was more individuality. They didn't have the same Botox look.

Critics were set up to hate _Heaven's Gate (1980)_ (qv) . . . the picture didn't work with the public. If it had, it would have been the same as _Titanic (1997)_ (qv). \"Titanic\" worked, so all is forgiven. Certain things may have been his fault.

She passed away a few years back. The only thing she ever said to me, toward the last, she said, 'I want out of here, I am tired.' And I said 'No, no, three more years. We get the century mark.' I figured I could coax her into more after that, but when she finally did pass away, she couldn't talk because she had had a stroke. They said do you want to be resuscitated for while, and she said 'no.' So, I had to grant her that wish. She had no fear and I think as you get older -- you probably have more fear as a younger person than you do as an older person. Because as an older person you have stacked up a lot of background and time-in-grade, so to speak, so you are probably thinking what the hell 'I have had a good time.", "If you believe in reincarnation you're putting too much on the other side.
