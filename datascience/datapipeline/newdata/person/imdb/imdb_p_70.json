His father, James Chester Reynolds, was a food wholesaler, and his mother, Tamara Lee \"Tammy\" (Stewart), worked as a retail-store saleswoman. He has Irish and Scottish ancestry. Between 1991-93, Ryan appeared in _Fifteen (1990)_ (qv), a Nickleodeon series taped in Florida with many other Canadian actors. After the series ended, he returned to Vancouver where he played in a series of forgettable television movies. He did small roles in 'Glenn Close' (qv)'s _Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story (1995)_ (qv) and CBS's update of _In Cold Blood (1996)_ (qv). However, his run of luck had led him to decide to quit acting.One night, he ran into fellow Vancouver actor and native 'Chris William Martin' (qv). Martin found Ryan rather despondent and told him to pack everything: they were going to head to Los Angeles, California. The two stayed in a cheap Los Angeles motel. On the first night of their stay, Reynolds' jeep was rolled downhill and stripped. For the next four months, Ryan drove it without doors. In 1997, he landed the role of Berg in _Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998)_ (qv). Initially, the show was reviled by critics and seemed desperate for any type of ratings success. However, it was renewed for a second season but with a provision for a makeover by former _Roseanne (1988)_ (qv) writer 'Kevin Abbott' (qv). The show became a minor success and has led to additional film roles for Ryan, most notably in the last-ever MGM film, a remake of _The Amityville Horror (2005)_ (qv). Ryan was engaged to Canadian singer-songwriter 'Alanis Morissette' (qv), another Nickelodeon veteran, between 2004-2006.He has been married to 'Blake Lively' (qv) since September 9, 2012.

Films like _Rope (1948)_ (qv) and _Lifeboat (1944)_ (qv) and _Rear Window (1954)_ (qv), that was what they were all about. I had a lot of confidence in Rodrigo, though. He sent me a comprehensive, 15-page treatise on why he wanted to make the film. That hooked me. It's not the most glamorous role.

I'm sure I have a lot to atone for, if there is a judgment day. It's gonna be a long list for me. It goes right up until I was about 18 and then I sort of straightened out.", "For every character I play, there's ten others I've read that went to another actor because he's better qualified for the role, or for whatever reason, who knows - it's always a very mercurial process.", "As an actor, you're always kind of cognizant that you'll never work again. You always have this lizard-brain fear, always, just under the surface, that this is it. Because you see it. I've been fortunate enough to have a 23-year career so far. I've watched people come and go and vanish. I've watched really talented people never get that invaluable foothold into the industry.

It's just not something I've ever been really that great at, to be totally blunt. But I have immense respect for those who are great at it. I also think that our idea of a traditional leading man, archetypal male is changing wildly day to day, over the last five years in particular. And I think that's great. I think that's evolution, to put in in Pikachu terms.", "I'm terrified that I'm genetically predisposed to only having boys. That's frightening.
