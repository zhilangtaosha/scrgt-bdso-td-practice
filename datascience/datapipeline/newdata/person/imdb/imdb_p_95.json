The thing I keep saying to them lately is: \"I have to love you, and I have the right to ignore you.\" When my kids ask what I want for my birthday or Christmas or whatever, I use the same answer my father did: \"Peace and quiet.\" That was never a satisfactory answer to me as a kid - I wanted an answer like \"A pipe.\" But now I see the wisdom of it: All I want is you at your best - you making this an easier home to live in, you thinking of others. -on fathering", "When I work, my first relationship with people is professional. There are people who want to be your friend right away. I say, \"We're not gonna be friends until we get this done. If we don't get this done, we're never going to be friends, because if we don't get the job done, then the one thing we did together that we had to do together we failed.\" People confuse friendship and relaxation. It's incredibly important to be relaxed - you don't have a chance if you're not relaxed. So I try very hard to relax any kind of tension. But friendship is different. I read a great essay: Thoreau on friendship. I was staying over at my friend's house and there it was on the bedside table, and I'm reading it and I'm thinking it's an essay, so it's gonna be like four pages. Well, it goes on and on and on and on - Thoreau was a guy who lived alone, so he just had to get it all out, you know? He just keeps saying, \"You have to love what is best in that other person and only what's best in that other person. That's what you have to love\".", "Well, he was a guy who had great knowledge of the craft of improvisation. And he lived life in a very rich manner, to excess sometimes. He had a whole lot of brain stuck inside of his skull. Beyond being gifted, he really engaged in life. He earned a lot. He made more of himself than he was given. Came out of Manhattan, Kansas, and ended up hanging out with the Beats. He was incredibly gracious to your talent and always tried to further it. He got people to perform beyond their expectations. He really believed that anyone could do it if they were present and showed respect. There was a whole lot of respect. He taught lots and lots of people very effectively. He taught people to commit. Like: \"Don't walk out there with one hand in your pocket unless there's something' in there you're going to bring out.\" You gotta commit. You've gotta go out there and improvise and you've gotta be completely unafraid to die. You've got to be able to take a chance to die. And you have to die lots. You have to die all the time. You're going' out there with just a whisper of an idea. The fear will make you clench up. That's the fear of dying. When you start and the first few lines don't grab and people are going like, \"What's this? I'm not laughing and I'm not interested,\" then you just put your arms out like this and open way up and that allows your stuff to go out. Otherwise it's just stuck inside you. -on his acting teacher 'Del Close' (qv)", "I think everyone in the acting business wants to make the right choices. You want to say no at the right time and you want to say yes more sparingly. I came out of the old Second City in Chicago. Chicago actors are more hard-nosed. They're tough on themselves and their fellow actors. They're self-demanding. Saying no was very important. Integrity is probably too grand a word, but if you're not the voice of Mr. Kool-Aid, then you're still free. You're not roped in.", "I'm not trying to be coy. It's just practical for me. When the phone started ringing too many times, I had to take it back to what I can handle. I take my chances on a job or a person as opposed to a situation. I don't like to have a situation placed over my head.", "The more relaxed you are, the better you are at everything: the better you are with your loved ones, the better you are with enemies, the better you are at your job, the better you are with yourself.", "[on preparing to play President Roosevelt] This great director we had at Second City ('Del Close' (qv)) said, 'You wear your character like a trench coat. It's still you in there, but there's,like, a trench coat'. So I figured this was like a winter trench coat, because there was just a little bit more character that comes to the party. So I did a lot more reading, a lot more studying.", "[on encountering fans] I'm of the habit that if people are waiting outside the hotel, you don't sign your autographs there. Because that means when you come back in the middle of the night, they're still there. It's usually a one-time thing. That's it; that's your one time. You try your hardest but you can't always be perfect.", "[on screenplays] The early days, you could change every single word and no one cared. It was like, 'That's fine. That was terrible anyway'. But now, if the script's really good, you don't need to change very much.", "The only thing we really, surely have is hope. You hope that you can be alive, that things will happen to you that you'll actually witness, that you'll participate in. Rather than life just rolling over you, and you wake up and it's Thursday, and what happened on Monday? Whatever the best part of my life has been, has been the result of that remembering.", "[on reconnecting with earlier performances] When you did the job, you thought you were just trying to amuse your friends who are all on the job. I'm just trying to make the sound guy laugh, the script supervisor. A movie like _Caddyshack (1980)_ (qv), I can walk on a golf course and some guy will be screaming entire scenes at me and expecting me to do it word for word with him. It's like, 'Fella, I did that once. I improvised that scene. I don't remember how it goes'. But I'm charmed by it. I'm not like, 'Hey, knock it off'. It's kind of cool.", "[on bringing improv experience into real life] It pays off in your life when you're in an elevator and people are uncomfortable. You can just say, 'That's a beautiful scarf'. It's just thinking about making someone else feel comfortable. You don't worry about yourself, because we're vibrating together. If I can make yours just a little bit groovier, it'll affect me. It comes back, somehow.", "[on developing a film character] I hate to give away my secrets but I do almost nothing. Being slightly lazy works for me.", "[on 'McG' (qv)'s claim that Murray head-butted him on the set of _Charlie's Angels (2000)_ (qv)] That's bulls---! That's complete crap! I don't know why he made that story up. He has a very active imagination...No! He deserves to die! He should be pierced with a lance, not head-butted.", "[on his altercation with 'Lucy Liu' (qv) on the set of _Charlie's Angels (2000)_ (qv)] Look, I will dismiss you completely if you are unprofessional and working with me...When our relationship is professional, and you're not getting that done, forget it.", "[on his altercation with 'Lucy Liu' (qv) on the set of _Charlie's Angels (2000)_ (qv)] We began rehearsing this scene and I said, 'Lucy, how can you want to say these lines? These are so crazy.' She got furious with me because she thought it was a personal assault, but the reality is she hated these lines as much as I did. But for 15 or 20 minutes there, we went to our separate corners and threw hand-grenades and sky rockets at each other. We made peace and I got to know her better from that day, and I feel very warmly for her now.", "If I hadn't been a comedian or an actor or whatever it is that I am now, I would have been a professional athlete, probably a baseball player.", "If you have someone that you think is The One, don't just sort of think in your ordinary mind, \"Okay, let's make a date, let's plan this and make a party and get married\". Take this person and travel around the world. Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel around the world. And go to places that are hard to get into and hard to get out of, and when you come back to JFK, when you land and you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport.", "(On his fight with 'Chevy Chase' (qv)) It was an Oedipal thing, a rupture. Because we all felt mad he had left us, and somehow I was the anointed avenging angel, who had to speak for everyone. But Chevy and I are friends now. It's all fine.", "(Interview with Jessica Lee Jernigan (May 1999)) I think that the online world has actually brought books back. People are reading because they're reading the damn screen. That's more reading than people used to do.", "You show me an actor doing a shit movie, I'll show you a guy with a bad divorce.", "(Rolling Stone interview) I think _The Razor's Edge (1984)_ (qv) is a pretty good movie. But at the time, it was just as reviled as any other comedian doing a serious thing now. Like _The Majestic (2001)_ (qv) [with 'Jim Carrey' (qv)], movies where comedians go straight, people don't like them. It angers people, like you're taking something away from them. That's the response I got. I thought, \"Well, aren't we all bigger than that?\" I wasn't shocked by it, but I thought that the professional critics would be able to say, \"OK, we shouldn't rule this out, because the guy normally does other stuff.\" Unless it's really despicable, then you have to just jump with both feet on the neck.", "(On _The Razor's Edge (1984)_ (qv) as quoted in Stills Magazine) I don't know what my fans are going to think. It's definitely not what they're used to from me.", "I think romance basically starts with respect. And new romance always starts with respect. I think I have some romantic friendships. Like the song \"Love the One You're With\"; there is something to that. It's not just make love to whomever you're with, it's just love whomever you're with. And love can be seeing that here we are and there's this world here. If I go to my room and I watch TV, I didn't really live. If I stay in my hotel room and watch TV, I didn't live today.", "Melancholic and lovable is the trick, right? You've got to be able to show that you have these feelings. In the game of life, you get these feelings and how you deal with those feelings. What you do when you are trying to deal with a melancholy. A melancholy can be sweet. It's not a mean thing, but it's something that happens in life - like autumn.", "When you become famous, you've got like a year or two where you act like a real asshole. You can't help yourself.
