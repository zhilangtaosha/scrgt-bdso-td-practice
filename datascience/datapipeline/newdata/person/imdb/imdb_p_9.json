That's creepy.\" The people who know us are happy, and probably expected it to happen eventually. But yeah, every once in a while we get that one person that's like, \"That's really creepy. You just kissed your sister.\" We thought it was weird for six months, but it had more to do with just trying to hide our relationship from the set. I don't know why, and looking back on it, it was foolish. But we were trying to stay secretive and didn't want it to get out there. It never really weirded us out that we played brother and sister, because, you know, it's all fiction.", "[on dating _Everwood (2002)_ (qv) co-star 'Emily VanCamp' (qv)] Obviously, they can never tell you not to date anybody on set. But it's always looked at as being a bit, \"You should be a little apprehensive about getting involved with somebody that you work with.\" But we weren't apprehensive at all. We just said, \"Fuck it. Let's just go for it, because it's important to us.\" But, that being said, other people may have had doubts or suspicions about us being able to last and this and that. Basically, once we get on set, we really just kind of became our characters and left our relationship behind. We would sneak a kiss here and there, but we would try and stay as professional as possible so no one would get uncomfortable. We certainly would never bring any arguments to the set or anything like that.", "You can pour melted ice cream on regular ice cream. It's like a sauce!", "I have a pet lizard named Puff, five goldfish - named Pinky, Brain, Jowels, Pearl and Sandy, an oscar fish named Chef, two pacus, an albino African frog named Whitey, a bonsai tree, four Venus flytraps, a fruit fly farm and sea monkeys.", "The only way physical comedy works is if you don't see it coming. And the harder the fall, the funnier it is. You have to really take some shots, and I've walked away with some bumps and bruises.", "Just be comfortable with who you are.", "Just be yourself and forget all of the stuff you read in 'GQ' magazine.", "I know this may come as a shock to most of you, but I've decided to quit acting. I will not be auditioning for anything anymore, and if I get offered something like a role in a movie or a commercial or something, I will graciously turn it down. It's been great, but its just not for me anymore.", "Being in good physical shape is the best way to combat depression. You just have endorphins running around your body. It is the best anti-depressive that there is.", "I have a lot of plants and fish and a pet lizard and Venus flytraps. I have a whole ecosystem in my room, like a running waterfall and different lights and sensors set on digital timers.", "You know, I just tend to grow my beard out for _Parks and Recreation (2009)_ (qv). As an actor, it's always easier to shave or cut your hair for a role, but it's hard to put fake hair on or grow hair for a role. When you look at pictures of me, the longer my hair is, the longer my facial hair is, that's just the longer I haven't gotten a job.", "The key is just to ignore the pain, because physical comedy only works if you see someone get hurt and they aren't actually hurt. If someone gets hit in the face with a bat, falls down, and gets back up, it's funny. If they stay down and their jaw is wired shut in the next scene, it's really tragic and weird. You have to pretend it doesn't hurt.", "My favorite way to blow off steam is to sing obnoxiously loud in the shower.", "I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will clean them out of their beets.", "It's interesting - I always thought when I was doing more melodramatic stuff like 'Everwood' that the directors were constantly reeling me in and stopping me from being funny.", "There's nothing funnier than a giant, grown man rollerblading.", "With comedy, it's a combination of knowing the comedic beat was good - it made you laugh, it made people on the crew laugh.

I was a wrestler, I played football, so I can take a fall. I actually wanted to be a stuntman when I was kid, so I would practice falling down the stairs. It's just something I like to do.", "I primarily have had my career in comedy, and that is something that I have never been too concerned about because I know there is really no room for vanity in comedy. Comedy comes from pain and it is a lot easier to empathize with somebody who is out of shape.", "People have told me I look like 'Gordon Lightfoot' (qv).", "Some people fast, some people go on a cruise or visit a day spa.

That was ten years ago. That got me to Hollywood. I got paid $700 bucks.", "When you're working with film, you can only shoot one angle at a time, and then everything has to stop, and you re-light it and shoot everything else from the opposite side, so it's really important that you stick exactly to what's written.", "I was an athlete growing up and I miss that. I miss hanging out with dudes and making raunchy jokes and telling stories, trading details, you know? There's something I really miss about that.", "To go to the Oscars for _Moneyball (2011)_ (qv) - that was pretty amazing.

That's still my main goal.", "I'm still fighting really hard to get any role I get. If it's comedy, I go for the laughs. And if it's drama, I try to tell the truth, and try to play the real stakes of whatever scenario the character's in.", "I don't have any delusions. I don't think I would make it through Navy SEAL training.", "My favorite animal to hunt is probably elk. There's nothing like the sound of a bugling bull splitting the cold air at first light. And that smell is unmistakable. Once you experience their musk in the wild there's no going back! A close second would be a varmint hunt.", "I'd love to work with 'Steve Martin' (qv). I'd love to work with 'Bill Murray' (qv) and 'Dan Aykroyd' (qv).", "_10 Years (2011)_ (qv) was probably - I might say \"10 Years\" was my favorite filming experience of anything I ever worked on. It was totally different from _Moneyball (2011)_ (qv), in that it was a small budget, independent movie. It had a giant ensemble of actors, all of whom were basically working for free.", "Who knew 'Rob Lowe' (qv) was funny? On _Parks and Recreation (2009)_ (qv), we've got some of the funniest comedy writers, some of the funniest comedians in the world working there.

I have a whole routine that I took from a bodybuilder. I was also a wrestler back in the day so I already knew how to dehydrate myself to cut weight but that was to create a low body weight and wasn't to create an aesthetic, unlike now. So I have a routine and it takes about a week - dehydration, cutting out carbohydrates, doing a series of salt baths and also flattering body make-up you know like a spray tan. And before the shot I'm doing push-ups, pull-ups and I have some dumbbells there. And you know the main thing you have to lose? Shame! On set, you have to be like, \"Yeah, I am the douche doing bicep curls just before my scene. There's a 100 of you and you are all judging me right now.
