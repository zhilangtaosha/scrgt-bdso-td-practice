She is the second child of Mary Elizabeth \"Betty\" (Reese) and Dr. John Draper Witherspoon, Sr. Her father was a military surgeon specializing in ear, nose and throat. Her mother was a Registered Nurse who later became a Ph.D in pediatric nursing. Reese spent the first four years of her life in Wiesbaden, Germany, where her father served as a lieutenant colonel in the US Army reserves. Shortly after, John moved the family back to the States, settling in Nashville, Tennessee.Reese was introduced to the entertainment industry at a very early age. At age 7, she began modeling. This led to appearances on several local television commercials. At age 11, she placed first in a Ten-State Talent Fair.In 1990, she landed her first major acting role in 'Robert Mulligan' (qv)'s _The Man in the Moon (1991)_ (qv). Her role as a 14-year old tomboy earned her rave reviews. Roles in bigger films such as _Jack the Bear (1993)_ (qv) and _A Far Off Place (1993)_ (qv) followed shortly after.Following high school graduation in 1994 from Harpeth Hall, a Nashville all girls school, Reese decided to put her acting career on hold and attend Stanford University where she would major in English literature. However, her collegiate plans were shortly dashed when she accepted roles to star in two major motion pictures: _Fear (1996)_ (qv), alongside 'Mark Wahlberg' (qv), and _Freeway (1996)_ (qv) with 'Kiefer Sutherland' (qv). Although neither film was a huge box-office success, they did help to establish Reese as a rising starlet in Hollywood and open the door for bigger and better film roles. Those bigger roles came in movies such as _Pleasantville (1998)_ (qv), _Election (1999)_ (qv) and _Cruel Intentions (1999)_ (qv).Her breakthrough role came as Elle Woods in the 2001 comedy, _Legally Blonde (2001)_ (qv). The movie was huge box-office smash and established Reese as one of the top female draws in Hollywood. The next year, she scored a follow-up hit with _Sweet Home Alabama (2002)_ (qv), which went on to gross over $100 million dollars at the box office. In 2006, she took home the best actress Oscar for her role as 'June Carter Cash' (qv) in the 'Johnny Cash' (qv) biopic, _Walk the Line (2005)_ (qv). In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Reese continued to star in more romantic comedies, such as _Four Christmases (2008)_ (qv) and _How Do You Know (2010)_ (qv). In December 2010, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In the year 2014, she produced both _Gone Girl (2014)_ (qv) and _Wild (2014)_ (qv), for which she got nominated for best actress Oscar again for her role as 'Cheryl Strayed' (qv).Off the screen, she was married to 'Ryan Phillippe' (qv) from 1999 to 2007. They met at her 21st birthday party and subsequently worked together in _Cruel Intentions (1999)_ (qv). They have two children: a daughter, Ava Elizabeth (born 9 September 1999) and a son, Deacon (born 23 October 2003). In March 2011, Reese remarried talent agent 'Jim Toth' (qv). She gave birth to a second son, Tennessee (born 27 September 2012).::SteveG"], "spouse": ["'Jim Toth' (qv)::(26 March 2011 - present) ( 1 child)", "'Ryan Phillippe' (qv)::(5 June 1999 - 13 June 2008) ( divorced) ( 2 children)"], "trade mark": ["Mostly plays chipper-type women convinced of their own successful destiny", "Expressive face", "Smooth voice with a strong southern accent", "Blonde hair and blue eyes"], "trivia": ["Majored in English Literature at Stanford University; on leave from her studies as of 1996.", "Shortly after she started acting, she had an audition for a role in _Cape Fear (1991)_ (qv).

They want to attribute all my success to teenagers seeing my movies. I really resent it when people say, \"It's just a genre film; it's a teen comedy.\" It takes a lot of work to make these things have heart and resonance so they're not just empty, disposable confections. But I don't give a damn about other people's perceptions, because I'll show them. For women in this business, ascendancy is always a battle. It's scrape and claw. I just try to stick to my guns and respect myself. I want to take the ing\u00e9nues aside and say, \"Value yourself! It's okay if you have opinions!\".

I was the girl who was always asking, \"Why? Yeah, I know you want me to do that - but why?\". I always thought people wanted to hear my opinions. ns] But I gave them anyway. It's just blind self-confidence. I get like a little terrier about things. My mother says I should have been an attorney.

There's no winning. You're never going to win the thin race. You're never going to win the pretty race. You're never going to win the smart race. You're never going to win the funny race.
