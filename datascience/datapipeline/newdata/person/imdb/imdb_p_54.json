His uncle is actor 'Denis Lawson' (qv). He was raised in Crieff. At age 16, he left Morrison Academy to join the Perth Repertory Theatre. His parents encouraged him to leave school and pursue his acting goals rather than be unhappy. McGregor studied drama for a year at Kirkcaldly in Fife, then enrolled at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama for a three-year course. He studied alongside 'Daniel Craig' (qv) and 'Alistair McGowan' (qv), among others, and left right before graduating after snagging the role of Private Mick Hopper in 'Dennis Potter' (qv)'s six-part Channel 4 series _Lipstick on Your Collar (1993)_ (qv). His first notable role was that of Alex Law in _Shallow Grave (1994)_ (qv), directed by 'Danny Boyle' (qv), written by 'John Hodge' (qv) and produced by 'Andrew Macdonald' (qv). This was followed by _The Pillow Book (1996)_ (qv) and _Trainspotting (1996)_ (qv), the latter of which brought him to the public's attention.He is now one of the most critically acclaimed actors of his generation, and portrays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the first three Star Wars episodes. McGregor is married to French production designer 'Eve Mavrakis' (qv), whom he met while working on the television series _Kavanagh QC (1995)_ (qv). They married in France in the summer of 1995, and have four daughters. McGregor formed a production company, with friends 'Jonny Lee Miller' (qv), 'Sean Pertwee' (qv), 'Jude Law' (qv), 'Sadie Frost' (qv), 'Damon Bryant' (qv), 'Bradley Adams' (qv) and 'Geoff Deehan' (qv), called \"Natural Nylon\", and hoped it would make innovative films that do not conform to Hollywood standards. McGregor and Bryant left the company in 2002. He was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Queen's New Years Honours List for his services to drama and charity.Ewan made his directorial debut with _American Pastoral (2016)_ (qv), an adaptation of 'Philip Roth' (qv)'s book, in which Ewan also starred.In 2018 McGregor won an Golden Globe for his work in the TV Series Fargo.::anonymous"], "spouse": ["'Eve Mavrakis' (qv)::(22 July 1995 - present) ( filed for divorce) ( 4 children)"], "trade mark": ["Mischievous smile", "Scottish accent", "Red hair and blue eyes", "Mole on his forehead, until he had it removed"], "trivia": ["Former roommate of 'Jude Law' (qv).

The role ultimately went to 'Leonardo DiCaprio' (qv). While McGregor blamed studio influence for the casting decision, he did not speak to either Boyle nor Hodge for years afterwards, commenting in an interview that he felt betrayed and the friendship was over. McGregor said that they bumped into each other several times during that period, which led to a very awkward moment where both he, his wife and Boyle ended up in first class on the same flight, and didn't talk to each other for the entire duration of the trip. However, McGregor and Boyle finally made amends in 2009, when McGregor presented Boyle an award for Slumdog Millionaire.

You're married?\" Strange reaction to have. Proves what people's ideas about marriage are. \"We're having a baby.\" \"What?\" As if it's the end of the world. Of course, it's the start of a brilliant world.", "From _Velvet Goldmine (1998)_ (qv), I got fond of wearing nail polish and eye makeup. I used to wear it quite a lot. We all wear makeup when we go to events - men and women alike. I've also had some good makeup artists, and I like to let them have a good time. I don't think we should pretend we're not wearing makeup when we are. I quite like the look of it.", "When I played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars prequels, I had to transform myself into a young 'Alec Guinness' (qv). I watched his early work to see what he was like on screen. It is interesting how he is only remembered by people younger than myself for appearing in Star Wars. He played a wealth of characters in lots of films - it was like he was the British film industry.", "[on his decision to quit cigarettes and alcohol] I wasn't someone who could smoke or drink in moderation, and I recognized that those things would kill me. I started visualizing the doctor telling me that I had cancer from smoking or that I was extremely ill because of how much I'd been drinking. What kind of regret would I have if I had to tell my children or my wife that I was dying because of something I could have done something about? I didn't want to be that kind of man.", "In your 20s, you spend a lot of time being self-conscious about what other people think of you. Then you hit your mid-30s and start to realize they weren't really thinking about you that much.", "[on rejecting the idea of a _Trainspotting (1996)_ (qv) sequel] I wouldn't want to damage _Trainspotting (1996)_ (qv)'s reputation, because it was an amazing film and a very important film of its time, a very important film for me and... a very important film for British cinema. I wouldn't want to leave people remembering a poor sequel rather than leaving its reputation where it sits at the moment, which is kind of a phenomenal film.", "There was talk that Disney fended off the release [of _I Love You Phillip Morris (2009)_ (qv)] until after _A Christmas Carol (2009)_ (qv) came out. They didn't want kids thinking ['Jim Carrey' (qv)'s] Ebenezer Scrooge was a bender.", "[on _I Love You Phillip Morris (2009)_ (qv)] I'm very keen that it's a gay movie. There was quite a lot of talk at Sundance (in 2009) that \"Well, it's not a gay movie. It's a film about guys who happen to be gay.\" And I was thinking, it's nothing but a gay movie. It's about a gay couple, about a man's sexuality, and he comes out. It's not the point of the film, but let's not pretend it's not a gay film.", "I like kissing boys on screen. As a straight guy, it's quite an interesting proposition. Anything on a film set that takes you by surprise like that, that gets your blood up, is good.", "I'm always interested in playing different people, in different situations. It doesn't matter to me whether someone is in love with a man or a woman. I find the idea of love and romance interesting. I'm a sucker for it. I like playing someone who's falling in love because I like the sensation of it. People do extraordinary things when they're falling in love.", "I go on my gut instincts. Occasionally, the thought of working for a director pricks up my ears, or being alongside an actor gets me interested, But if the story can't live in my head when I read the script, I feel I can't be bothered to live with it on set.", "... There's many different factors in films. The script, I always believe, is the foundation of everything. And if you don't connect to that foundation, if you don't believe in that and feel that you wanna spend three, four months of your life exploring it, then all of the other elements are secondary. But if you've got a great foundation in the script, and you like the story... Sometimes it's the story, sometimes it's the atmosphere in the script, the world that you're gonna create. There's many different things that hook you in, and then, on top of that, you have who's directing, who are the other actors, who's lighting-those creative elements that come in. Everyone's tied to the script. I think the script is the key. Regardless of how great everybody else is working on a film, if you're working on a script that you don't think is great, you're not gonna be able to make a great film. Whereas if the script is great, then you can.", "[on quitting drinking] I would soon have gotten a reputation for being a drunk actor and therefore would not get any work, so I really felt it was time to give it up. But I remember doing interviews, drinking and smoking, just saying, \"I am never, ever going to fucking stop!\" And I said it with real pride, you know? 'Cos I wanted to be the best drinker as well as everything else and that's a really bad slippery slope. So it's much easier now and my work's much better. I find that life in general's much more fun without it. My wife's delighted that I stopped, because I'm much more present in our marriage and I'm a much better father. I remember, funnily enough, the last time I had a drink. I was sitting with these guys and we're all talking about how much we love our kids and I thought, \"Well, why are we all sitting in a pub? It's four in the morning. How much do we love our kids? Because tomorrow morning none of us will be any use to them.\" And I thought, \"Fuck it.\" I don't have a problem with people drinking; it's something I chose not to do. It just took me a long time to grow up.", "[on _The Impossible (2012)_ (qv)] When the script first came to me, I wasn't sure about the idea. Would it be a disaster movie that was somehow spectacular? That would be so wrong. But as I read it, I got caught up in Maria's sense of courage. She seemed like a proper hero. Then I spoke to her and she said, no, that's not what it was about - it was all down to luck. She was really emphatic about that. She said, \"If anything I did was heroic, what would that mean for the others who weren't so lucky?\".", "The Thai perspective on the tsunami I thought was quite a healthy one. They're very straightforward and honest about it, and very much in the present in terms of moving forward.", "[on whether he has remained friends with director 'Danny Boyle' (qv) after getting dropped from _The Beach (2000)_ (qv) for 'Leonardo DiCaprio' (qv)] No, you just don't treat your friends like that. They absolutely made me think that I was playing the character in The Beach and we talked about dates and moving dates and so on, and all the while they were keeping me there just in case Leonardo pulled out - which is really nasty. And then afterwards, I just didn't hear from Danny for years.", "Pay attention: I recognize it can be boring to play with young children - to tell a story over and over again, let's say - but the secret is being there. If you've made a decision to play with your children, then play with them. Don't be looking through papers on your desk or sneaking off to the computer. Turn off your BlackBerry. Lose yourself in their world. Even if you do it for a short time, it will mean a lot to you and to them.", "[About his falling out and reconciliation with former friend and director 'Danny Boyle' (qv)]: I just think I've changed my opinion about it. We've all moved on and there's a lot of water under the bridge.", "You know how swimming naked is such a lovely feeling? Well, being naked on set is kind of a bit like that.", "I'm not a religious person... I'm married to a Jewish woman, so my children are Jewish and my involvement in religion has more to do with the Jewish faith now and not the Christian faith, which I was very vaguely brought up in... My parents were not religious, but my school had prayers at morning assembly... So my early understanding of religion was the Protestant faith in Scotland. But my experience is no longer that.", "[on the sometimes questionable food he and 'Charley Boorman' (qv) encountered on their _Long Way Round (2004)_ (qv) and _Long Way Down (2007)_ (qv) motorcycle adventures] Usually, it was something like beans and paste with chunks of bread, but occasionally you'd just have to close your eyes, hold your nose, and hope for the best. The only time we ever got sick was when we ate at hotels. That stuff just sits around in its own botulism.", "[After a fan asks him what advice would give for a young Jedi in training] Don't be ridiculous!", "(On _Emma (1996)_ (qv)) \"My decision-making was wrong. It's the only time I've done that. And I learnt from it, you know. So I'm glad of that - because it was early on and I learnt my lesson. It's a good film, _Emma (1996)_ (qv), but I'm just... not very good in it. I'm not helped because I'm also wearing the world's worst wig. It's quite a laugh, checking that wig out.\"", "(on playing two characters in _Fargo (2014)_ (qv)) I'm very experienced with playing with myself", "[on the possibility of a Obi-Wan Kenobi spin off film] There's no official offer, and I haven't met them about it or anything. But I've always said that I'd be happy to do it if they wanted to do it. It would be a good segue between the last episode of the prequels and the new episodes. I think they've got films to make until the 2020s, so I don't think it's going to happen soon if it happens at all.", "Me and 'Colin Farrell' (qv) lovers? Yes. You heard it here first. Friends, lovers, all of those things. ['Colin Farrell' (qv): We're lovers, but only physically. No movies, no dinners, or long meaningful conversations caring about how the other person is doing in their lives. We just like to make love every now and then. Once a year is going to be the deal, like Woody Allen makes his films. We're going to make love once a year. He does look well, doesn't he? Very dapper. It's the accent as well that gets me.] We plan to hang out together tonight. I'm going to watch a film with people who like to watch films. Then Colin and I are going to go crazy!", "[Entertainment Weekly, June 1997] When I met with agents in L.A., they would tell me you had to do two movies for yourself and then two for the business. And I thought, 'Fuck off. No, you don't. You do every film because you want to do good work. Because you're interested in making good movies and working with good people.'
