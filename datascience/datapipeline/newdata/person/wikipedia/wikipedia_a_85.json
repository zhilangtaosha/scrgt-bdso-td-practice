Fisher's paternal grandparents were Russian-Jewish immigrants, while her mother, who was raised a Nazarene, was of Scots-Irish and English descent.Fisher was two years old when her parents divorced in 1959. Her father's third marriage, to actress Connie Stevens, resulted in the births of Fisher's two half-sisters, Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher. In 1960, her mother married Harry Karl, owner of a chain of shoe stores. Reynolds and Karl divorced in 1973, when Fisher was 17 years old.Fisher \"hid in books\" as a child, becoming known in her family as \"the bookworm\". She spent her earliest years reading classic literature and writing poetry. She attended Beverly Hills High School until age 16, when she appeared as a debutante and singer in the hit Broadway revival Irene (1973), starring her mother. Her time on Broadway interfered with her education, resulting in Fisher's dropping out of high school. In 1973, Fisher enrolled at London's Central School of Speech and Drama, which she attended for 18 months. Following her time there, Fisher applied to and was accepted at Sarah Lawrence College, where she planned to study the arts. She later left without graduating.", "Career": "=== 1970s ===\n\nFisher made her film debut at age 18 as the precociously seductive character Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy Shampoo (1975).

In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas' science-fiction film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. At the time, she believed the script for Star Wars was fantastic, but did not expect many people to agree with her. Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.In April 1978, Fisher appeared as the love interest in Ringo Starr's 1978 TV special Ringo. The next month, she starred alongside John Ritter (who had also appeared in Ringo) in the ABC-TV film Leave Yesterday Behind. At this time, Fisher appeared with Laurence Olivier and Joanne Woodward in the anthology series Laurence Olivier Presents in a television version of the William Inge play Come Back, Little Sheba.

The costume later achieved a following of its own. In 1986 she starred along with Barbara Hershey and Mia Farrow in Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters.\nIn 1987, Fisher published her first novel, Postcards from the Edge. The book was semi-autobiographical in the sense that she fictionalized and satirized real-life events such as her drug addiction of the late 1970s and her relationship with her mother. It became a bestseller, and she received the Los Angeles Pen Award for Best First Novel. Also during 1987, she was in the Australian film The Time Guardian.

She was hired by George Lucas to polish scripts for his 1992 TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and the dialogue for the Star Wars prequel scripts.

Fisher claimed that Leia was \"Elderly. She's in an intergalactic old folks' home [laughs]. I just think she would be just like she was before, only slower and less inclined to be up for the big battle.\" After other media outlets reported this on March 6, 2013, her representative said the same day that Fisher was joking and that nothing was announced.In a January 2014 interview, Fisher confirmed her involvement and the involvement of the original cast in the upcoming sequels by saying \"as for the next Star Wars film, myself, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are expected to report to work in March or April.

Director Rian Johnson has stated that many of Fisher's own ideas made it into the film, and that she supplied a few of Leia's lines. Variety reported following her death that Fisher was slated to appear in The Rise of Skywalker, and that Lucasfilm, Disney, and others involved with the film will need to find a way to address her death and what will become of her character. In July 2018, it was announced that Fisher would appear posthumously in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker via unreleased footage from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.Fisher's memoir, The Princess Diarist, was released in November 2016. The book is based on diaries she kept while filming the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In 1980, she was briefly engaged to Canadian actor and comedian Dan Aykroyd, who proposed to her on the set of their film The Blues Brothers. She said: \"We had rings, we got blood tests, the whole shot. But then I got back together with Paul Simon.\" Fisher was married to Simon from August 1983 to July 1984, and they dated again for a time after their divorce. During their marriage, she appeared in Simon's music video for the song \"Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War\". Simon's song \"Hearts and Bones\" is about their romance.She subsequently had a relationship with Creative Artists Agency principal and talent agent Bryan Lourd. Their first and only child, Billie Lourd, was born in 1992. Eddie Fisher stated in his autobiography (Been There Done That) that his granddaughter's name is Catherine Fisher Lourd and her nickname is \"Billy\". The couple's relationship ended when Lourd left to be in a homosexual relationship. In interviews, Fisher described Lourd as her second husband, but  a 2004 profile of the actress and writer revealed that she and Lourd were never legally married.In her 2016 autobiography The Princess Diarist, Fisher wrote that she and Harrison Ford had a three-month affair during the filming of Star Wars  in 1976.Fisher also had a close relationship with singer James Blunt. While working on his album Back to Bedlam in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher's residence. When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: \"Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster, and he gets 'fight or flight.' You know, he comes from a long line of soldiers dating back to the 10th century. He would tell me these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient.\"On February 26, 2005, R. Gregory \"Greg\" Stevens, a 42 year old lobbyist, was found dead in Fisher's California home. The final autopsy report listed the cause of death as \"cocaine and oxycodone use\" but added chronic, and apparently previously undiagnosed, heart disease as contributing factors. Media coverage of an initial autopsy report used the word \"overdose,\" but that wording is not in the final report. In an interview, Fisher claimed that Stevens' ghost haunted her mansion, which unsettled her: \"I was a nut for a year\", she explained, \"and in that year I took drugs again.\"Fisher described herself as an \"enthusiastic agnostic who would be happy to be shown that there is a God\". She was raised Protestant, but often attended Jewish services (her father's faith) with Orthodox friends.In 2016, Harvard College gave Fisher its Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism, noting that \"her forthright activism and outspokenness about addiction, mental illness, and agnosticism have advanced public discourse on these issues with creativity and empathy.\"Fisher was a supporter and advocate for several causes, including women's advocacy, animal rights, and LGBT causes.

She said her drug use was a form of self-medication; she used pain medication such as Percodan to \"dial down\" the manic aspect of her bipolar disorder. She gave nicknames to her bipolar moods: Roy (\"the wild ride of a mood\") and Pam (\"who stands on the shore and sobs\"). \"Drugs made me feel more normal\", she explained to Psychology Today in 2001. \"They contained me.\" She discussed her 2008 memoir Wishful Drinking and various topics in it with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today that same year, and also revealed that she would have turned down the role of Princess Leia had she realized it would give her the celebrity status that made her parents' lives difficult. This interview was followed by a similar appearance on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on December 12, 2008, where she discussed her electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments. At one point, she received ECT every six weeks to \"blow apart the cement\" in her brain. In 2014, she said she was no longer receiving the treatment.In another interview, Fisher revealed that she used cocaine during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. \"Slowly, I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter\", she noted. In 1985, after months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed on a combination of prescription medication and sleeping pills. She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, Postcards from the Edge. Asked why she did not take on the role of her story's protagonist, named Suzanne, in the film version, Fisher remarked, \"I've already played Suzanne.\"In her later years, Fisher had an emotional support animal, a French Bulldog named Gary, whom she brought to numerous appearances and interviews. Following her death, reports indicated that Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd would take care of Gary.", "Death": "After finishing the European leg of her book tour (her last TV appearance was on an episode of 8 Out of 10 Cats broadcast 21 December 2016) Fisher was on a commercial flight on December 23, 2016, from London to Los Angeles when she suffered a medical emergency around fifteen minutes before the aircraft landed. A passenger seated near Fisher reported that she had stopped breathing; another passenger performed CPR on Fisher until paramedics arrived at the scene.

Many of her co-stars and directors from Star Wars and other works also shared their thoughts on her death.On January 9, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a death certificate that stated \"cardiac arrest/deferred\" as the cause of death. More tests were expected. In a June 16, 2017, news release, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that the exact cause of death could not be determined, but sleep apnea and the buildup of fatty tissue on the walls of arteries were among the contributing factors. A full report from June 19, 2017, stated that Fisher had cocaine in her system, as well as traces of heroin, other opiates, and MDMA. The report also stated that the investigation was unable to determine when she had taken the drugs, and whether they contributed to her death. Her daughter Billie Lourd stated that Fisher \"battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life [and] ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases... I know my Mom, she'd want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles.\"The day after Fisher's death, her mother Debbie Reynolds suffered a stroke at the home of son Todd, where the family was planning Fisher's burial arrangements. She was taken to a hospital, where she died later that afternoon. According to Todd Fisher, Reynolds had said, \"I want to be with Carrie\" immediately prior to suffering the stroke. On January 5, 2017, a joint private memorial was held for Fisher and Reynolds. Fisher was cremated while her mother was entombed. A portion of her ashes were laid to rest beside Reynolds in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills. The remainder of those ashes are held in a giant, novelty Prozac pill.In the absence of a star for Fisher on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, fans created their own memorial using a blank star. Along with flowers and candles, words put on the blank star read, \"Carrie Fisher | May The Force Be With You Always | Hope\". In the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, thousands of fans paid tribute to Fisher by gathering at House Organa on the planet Alderaan where Fisher's character in Star Wars resided. Lightsaber vigils and similar events in Fisher's honor were held at various Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas theaters and other sites. On January 6, 2017, the lights on Broadway in Manhattan were darkened for one minute in honor of Fisher and her mother.
