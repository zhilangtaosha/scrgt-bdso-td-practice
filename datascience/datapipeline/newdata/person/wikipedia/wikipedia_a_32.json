Levi was impressed by Bullock's performance and offered her a part in the made-for-television film Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1989).

It took in US$350 million worldwide.After the success of Speed, Bullock established herself as a Hollywood leading actress. In the romantic comedy While You Were Sleeping (1995), she portrayed a lonely Chicago Transit Authority token collector who saves the life of a man. While the film made US$182 million globally, it received positive reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reading: \"While You Were Sleeping is built wholly from familiar ingredients, but assembled with such skill\u2014and with such a charming performance from Sandra Bullock\u2014that it gives formula a good name.\" She received her first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

Alongside Ben Affleck, she played a free-spirited drifter who begins to talk to a writer in the 1999 romantic comedy Forces of Nature. The film was a commercial hit, grossing US$93 million worldwide, and Boxoffice Magazine remarked: \"The combination of Affleck's deadpan by-the-book persona with the spontaneity of Bullock's character sparks with convincing chemistry, their diverse personalities causing both to grow and bring to the surface what each is running away from or can't admit.\"\n\n\n=== Established career (2000\u20132008) ===\nBullock took on the role of a FBI agent who must go undercover as a beauty pageant contestant in the comedy Miss Congeniality (2000).

The film was called \"the most realistic and beautifully choreographed film ever set in space\" and some critics called Bullock's performance the best work of her career. Variety wrote:\n\nBullock inhabits the role with grave dignity and hints at Stone's past scars with sensitivity and tact, and she holds the screen effortlessly once Gravity becomes a veritable one-woman show ... the actress remains fully present emotionally, projecting a very appealing combo of vulnerability, intelligence and determination that not only wins us over immediately, but sustains attention all the way through the cathartic closing reels.\nGravity took in US$716 million at the box office worldwide and made it Bullock's second-most successful picture.
