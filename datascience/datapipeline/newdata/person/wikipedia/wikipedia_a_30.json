In his description of the group, he stated: \"It was Santa Barbara. It was the '80s. It was punk rock. You either had the children of rich, neglectful parents or children of poor, neglectful parents, so it was a mix. But we basically grew up the same way. I've never seen a group like that before or since.\" He admitted to stealing cars to pay for his drug use, which included heroin, a drug that he explained he did not like: \"I mean, I never got into it and I never died from it, which is a good thing.

All the impact that had on me that I hadn't moved past; I was always such a momma's boy. But I realized that I was on a destructive path.
