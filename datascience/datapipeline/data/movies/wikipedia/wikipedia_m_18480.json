It is the third film based on one of Cohen's characters from Da Ali G Show; the first were Ali G Indahouse and Borat.\n\n", "plot": "Gay Austrian fashion reporter Br\u00fcno Gehard is fired from his own television show, Funkyzeit mit Br\u00fcno (Funkytime with Br\u00fcno) after disrupting a Milan Fashion Week catwalk (whose audience included Paul McCartney), and his lover Diesel leaves him for another man. Accompanied by his assistant's assistant, Lutz, he travels to the United States to become \"the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler\".\nBr\u00fcno unsuccessfully attempts an acting career as an extra on NBC's Medium. He then interviews Paula Abdul, using \"Mexican chair-people\" in place of furniture (Abdul goes along with everything, explaining how she aspires to help people, until a naked man, adorned with sushi, is wheeled into the room). He then produces a celebrity interview pilot, showing him dancing erotically, criticizing Jamie Lynn Spears' fetus with reality TV star Brittny Gastineau, unsuccessfully attempting to \"interview\" actor Harrison Ford, and closing with a close-up of his penis being swung around by pelvic gyrations. A focus group reviewing the pilot hate it, calling it \"worse than cancer\". Br\u00fcno then decides to make a sex tape, thus he then interviews Ron Paul, claiming to have mistaken him for drag queen RuPaul. While waiting in a hotel room with Paul, Br\u00fcno flirts with him before undressing, causing Paul to leave angrily and call him \"queerer than the blazes\".\nBr\u00fcno consults a spiritualist to contact the deceased Rob Pilatus of Milli Vanilli (a former lover) for advice, miming various sex acts on the invisible \"Pilatus\". He consults charity PR consultants Nicole and Suzanne DeFosset to select a world problem to maximize his fame, choosing the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He flies to Jerusalem to interview former Mossad agent Yossi Alpher and Palestinian politician Ghassan Khatib and confuses hummus and Hamas. In an interview with Israeli and Palestinian professors he sings his own \"Dove of Peace\" while cajoling the two to caress each other's hands. He also meets with Ayman Abu Aita, a \"terrorist group leader, Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades\" in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, where he hopes to be kidnapped. Br\u00fcno insults Abu Aita's hair then says that \"King Osama\" looks like a dirty wizard or a homeless Santa Claus. Abu Aita's translator orders Br\u00fcno to leave. He stops off in Nairobi to pick up a few things, including a child, saying he is \"black gold\".\nBr\u00fcno interviews parents of child models, asking if their toddlers would be ready to lose weight, undergo liposuction, operate \"antiquated heavy machinery\" or \"amateur science\", or dress in Nazi uniforms. On a talk show hosted by Richard Bey, he shows the African American audience a baby he named O.J., whom he acquired in Africa by \"swapping him\" for a U2 Product Red iPod. He shows photographs of the boy covered with bees, on a crucifix and in a Jacuzzi next to male adults in a 69 position. The audience is appalled and social services take the baby from Br\u00fcno, driving him to depression. He goes to a diner to gorge on high-carb junk food. Lutz carries him back to a hotel room. After a night of sex, they awake to find themselves trapped in a bondage mechanism, unable to find the key. They call a hotel engineer for help and are asked to leave. After accosting a group of anti-gay protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church while still in bondage gear and boarding a bus, Br\u00fcno and Lutz remove their equipment at Madison County Office of Alternative Sentencing and Release in Huntsville, Alabama. After being arrested, Lutz says he loves Br\u00fcno, but Br\u00fcno tells him he does not love him, having been influenced by \"carb goggles\". Lutz leaves Br\u00fcno.\nAfter realizing the biggest names in Hollywood are straight (citing Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, and John Travolta), Br\u00fcno consults two gay converters to help him become heterosexual. He attempts other \"masculine\" activities, such as learning karate, joining the National Guard, going hunting in Alabama, and attending a swingers party, during which he is whipped by a dominatrix.\nEight months later, a now-heterosexual Br\u00fcno, under the alias \"Straight Dave\", hosts a cage-fight match in Arkansas, \"Straight Dave's Man Slammin' Maxout\". Lutz appears at the event and calls Br\u00fcno a \"faggot\". The two fight, only to rekindle their love, making out and stripping in front of shocked spectators who throw objects into the cage. The clip gets international press, and the now-famous Br\u00fcno attempts to marry Lutz, getting O.J. back in exchange for a MacBook Pro. At Abbey Road Studios Br\u00fcno records a charity song, \"Dove of Peace\", featuring Bono, Elton John (seated at a piano on a Mexican \"chair-person\"), Chris Martin, Snoop Dogg, Sting, and Slash."}
