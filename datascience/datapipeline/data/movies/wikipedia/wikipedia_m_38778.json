The elaborate mouse dioramas and \"mouseterpieces\" were created by The Chiodo Brothers.\n\n", "plot": "Tim Conrad, a mid-level financial analyst at a Los Angeles equity firm, comes up with a way to get wealthy Swiss businessman Martin Mueller as a client. Impressed by Tim's ingenuity, his boss Lance Fender says Tim is a candidate for a promotion but wants to get to know him better. He invites him to a \"dinner for winners\" in which he must find and bring an eccentric person with a special talent; the winner earns a trophy and the executive that brought him or her gets glory. Tim deduces that it is more of a \"dinner for idiots\" rather than winners, and the partygoers will be mocked. \nTim's girlfriend, Julie, lands a curator deal for eccentric artist Kieran Vollard and Tim unsuccessfully proposes to her, for the second time. Tim agrees not to attend the dinner party after Julie is appalled by the cruel nature of the theme.\nTim accidentally hits amateur taxidermist Barry Speck with his car when Barry tries to retrieve a dead mouse from the road. Witnessing Barry's bizarre behavior, Tim realizes he is the perfect idiot for the dinner. Barry shows up at Tim's apartment thinking that the dinner event was that same evening, and accidentally invites over Darla, who has been stalking Tim since their one-night stand years ago. Barry decides to guard Tim's apartment from Darla to make up for inviting her.\nWhen Julie arrives at his apartment, Barry mistakes her for Darla and sends her away, giving Julie the impression that Tim is cheating on her. Barry calls Vollard and finds the number saved in the phone. While talking to him, he and Tim think they hear Julie in the background and head to Vollard's apartment. Barry tosses Tim's keys through Vollard's apartment window and must break in, only to find Kieran preparing to make love to two girls dressed like animals (neither of whom is Julie) and head back home.\nUpon returning home, there is a knock on the door. Barry opens the door to find Darla waiting outside. Julie calls and asks Tim if he's having an affair and Darla steals the phone and stuffs it down her pants. The call ends abruptly, giving Julie the impression that Tim is, in fact, cheating on her. While Tim hides in his bedroom trying to reach Julie, Darla and Barry get into a bar-style fight, scaring Darla away. Julie left her phone at Tim's apartment and a voice message from Vollard reveals that Julie is leaving for his ranch.\nBarry offers to take Tim to his job at the IRS to find Vollard's ranch address, where they meet up with Barry's boss and rival, Therman Murch, who stole Barry's wife. Therman also claims to have the \"talent\" of mind control, and has authored a book about his talent. The three have a complicated encounter at the IRS office, which results in Tim getting audited. Tim leaves the next day for his brunch with the Muellers but Barry crashes, with Darla pretending to be Julie. Tim is pushed into asking Darla to marry him by Barry and Julie walks in during the proposal. Tim and Barry chase Julie down to Vollard's ranch, where Tim accidentally offends Barry.\nTo his surprise, Tim found Barry already at Fender's dinner party. Barry is a hit with the group, and is a shoo-in for the trophy, but unexpectedly, Therman arrives as another \"special guest\", embarrassing Barry with his mind control. Tim then tells Barry everything and, after some encouragement, gets Barry to win with \"brain control\", before causing his boss and fellow executives to reveal the truth. A guest reacts badly to the news and causes chaos in the process, with the venue being set on fire and Mueller losing a finger.\nTim is fired, as is Julie after Barry makes Vollard realize it would be a problem to have her continue working for him. Tim and Julie marry, Barry enters into a relationship with Darla, does some artwork with Vollard, and hosts a monthly \"breakfast for champions\" for all of the losers. Therman writes a book in a mental hospital and Tim gets a new museum started in Switzerland for Mueller. Fender's company goes into a big loss and he is dubbed \"Wall Street's Biggest Loser\" by the media."}
