The toys are excited to have a week of relaxation, but Barbie and Ken reveal themselves to have stowed away in Bonnie's backpack, hoping to join her in Hawaii. Bonnie leaves them in her room, however, much to Ken's horror and disappointment when he realizes they are not going to Hawaii. Barbie reveals to Woody that Ken planned to have their first kiss on a beach at sunset (based on a travel brochure), inspiring Woody, Buzz, and the rest of Bonnie's toys to work together and recreate their own version of Hawaii for the two. After various adventures in \"Hawaii\", Ken and Barbie share their first kiss in the snow at sunset, recreating the scene from the brochure. However, the two step off the edge of the porch without realizing it and end up buried in snow. In a post-credits scene, the other toys are trying to free them from a block of ice in which they are now frozen by using a hairdryer to melt the ice as Buzz describes it as the best vacation ever. Woody agrees with Buzz as Mr. Potato Head tries chiseling the ice with a screwdriver."}
