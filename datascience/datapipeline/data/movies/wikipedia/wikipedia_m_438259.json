It was first performed at the Apollo Theatre in London by the Incorporated Stage Society on 9 December 1928, starring a young Laurence Olivier, and soon moved to other West End theatres for a two-year run. It was included in Burns Mantle's The Best Plays of 1928\u20131929. The piece quickly became internationally popular, with numerous productions and tours in English and other languages. A 1930 film version was followed by other adaptations, and the play set a high standard for other works dealing with similar themes, and influenced playwrights including No\u00ebl Coward.\nSet in the trenches near Saint-Quentin, Aisne, in 1918, towards the end of the First World War, Journey's End gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British Army infantry company. The story plays out in the officers' dugout over four days from 18 March 1918 to 21 March 1918, the last few days before Operation Michael.\nSherriff considered calling it Suspense or Waiting, but eventually found a title in the closing line of a chapter of an unidentified book, \"It was late in the evening when we came at last to our journey's end\"."}
