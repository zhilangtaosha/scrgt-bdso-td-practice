One by one though, each of his children calls to cancel on him at the last minute. Feeling a bit down by the rejections, Frank decides to head out on a cross-country trip, visiting each of his kids. \nDespite warnings from his doctor, Frank takes a train to New York City, to see one of his sons, David. David does not appear to be home and never shows up so Frank leaves him a card and leaves town to see his other children. While he is waiting for David, he sees one of David's paintings in a nearby art gallery window.\nHis next visit is to daughter Amy in Chicago, who tells him it is a bad time to visit. She had turned down her father's earlier invitation to visit, saying that her son Jack was sick. However, once he gets to Amy's house, Frank realizes Jack was not sick and Amy was just making up an excuse. Frank hits a few golf balls with Jack in the yard of their impressive suburban home. Dinner is uncomfortable with tension between Jack and his father. The next morning, Frank accompanies Amy to her fancy downtown office and hears her agency's pitch for a TV ad. She takes him to the train station to visit his son Robert in Denver. While waiting, Amy introduces her father to a male co-worker.\nAs Frank travels to each of his children's homes, the film cuts to phone conversations between the siblings. David is in some type of trouble in Mexico, and Amy is going there to find out what is happening; the sisters and Robert agree to not tell their father about David until they know for sure.\nFrank arrives in Denver expecting to see Robert conduct the city's orchestra. It turns out Robert is \"only\" a percussionist. Robert also tells Frank his visit is at a bad time, as the orchestra is flying to Europe the next day, but this is a lie. So within hours Frank prepares to take a bus to Las Vegas to visit his daughter Rosie. Frank is adamant that each visit be a surprise, but Robert calls Rosie to warn her of his arrival.\nIn a lonely hall of the bus station, during an encounter with a drug addict, Frank offers money to the drug addict. He takes it but they get into a quarrel about him being grateful for Frank's gesture. Through physical force, the drug addict tries to take all of Frank's money but fails. As a result, Frank's medicine bottle falls on the floor. To retaliate, the drug addict stomps on the medicine and crushes them. Frank scrapes up some of the crushed pills because he must take his medicine on a daily basis. He calls his doctor for a prescription refill but does not tell the doctor that he is hundreds of miles from home, traveling against doctor's advice. He has a dream that David is in trouble.\nAfter missing his train, Frank arrives in Las Vegas late, catching a ride part-way from a female truck driver. Rosie meets him at the station in a stretch limo and tells him she was in a big show that ended the previous week. She takes him to her huge, fancy apartment, where her friend Jilly brings over her baby for babysitting. Frank overhears a message being left on an answering machine, indicating the apartment is actually borrowed from Rosie's friend. During dinner, Frank asks Rosie why his adult children never talked to him and told him things, when they told their mother everything. She reveals that they were not confortable opening up to him because he always expected too much of them and he was never a good listener. Frank is not comfortable, having a feeling that all his kids are lying to him and that something is wrong about David.\nFrank flies back home but \u2014 without any more pills \u2014 he has a heart attack in the plane's lavatory. Frank has another dream of his kids as young children and deduces each of their secrets by way of confronting them: Amy is separated from her husband which caused the tension between him and his son, Robert lied about going to Europe with his orchestra and Rosie is really a bisexual as well as the mother of the child Jilly brought over. Frank awakens in hospital, with Amy, Robert and Rosie around his bedside. Frank confronts his children about their lies and they finally reveal him that David had died from an overdose and that he had been depressed. During the night, Frank has a vision about a young David being in his hospital room. Frank tells him that he would have been happy about him no matter how he turned out to be and that he was sorry. David reassures him that it was not his fault and leaves.\nAfter recovering Frank visits his wife's grave and talks to her. He tells her all about the kids and his regrets about pushing them too much and not trying to understand them more. Frank goes back to the Art Gallery below David's apartment to buy David's painting, but it has already been sold. The girl at the desk tells him that if any of David's art comes through, she would let him know. After leaving, she runs out to tell Frank about how great his son was, upon realizing the family connection after reading the contact info he left. She shows him another painting by David that is more appropriate to him \u2014 a landscape showing PVC-covered power lines made out of glue and macaroni in homage to Frank's career. The last scene shows the family at Christmas. All three children are around the house helping cook and decorate the tree. It is also revealed that Rosie and Jilly are a couple and are raising the baby together. Frank finally walks into the dining room and they happily eat together.", "cast": "Robert De Niro as Frank Goode\nDrew Barrymore as Rosie GoodeMackenzie Milone as the young Rosie\nKate Beckinsale as Amy GoodeLily Mo Sheen as the young Amy\nSam Rockwell as Robert GoodeSeamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as the young Robert\nAustin Lysy as David Goode\nChandler Frantz as the young David\nKatherine Moennig as Jilly, Rosie's partner\nMelissa Leo as Colleen, the truck driver\nLucian Maisel as Jack, Amy's son\nDamian Young as Jeff, Amy's estranged husband\nJames Frain as Tom, Amy's current partner\nSonja Stuart as Jean Goode\nMimi Lieber provides Jean Goode's voice"}
