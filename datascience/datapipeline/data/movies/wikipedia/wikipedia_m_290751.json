The film stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Dean Norris, and Michael Kelly.\nThe film was released by STXfilms on November 20, 2015. It received mixed reception from critics, who praised its performances but compared it unfavorably to the original.\n\n", "plot": "In 2002, shortly after 9/11, Ray Kasten (Ejiofor), a counterterrorism agent for the FBI, and his friend Jessica \"Jess\" Cobb (Roberts), an investigator for the Los Angeles district attorney's office, meet new ADA Claire Sloan (Kidman). Jess and Ray receive a call about an unknown female body found in a dumpster near a local mosque, which Ray has been investigating for possible terrorist links. At the crime scene, both are devastated to discover that the victim is Jess's 18-year-old daughter, Carolyn (Zoe Graham), whose body has been bleached inside and out to destroy DNA evidence of both rape and murder.\nRay, who was supposed to meet Carolyn to plan a surprise party for Jess, feels responsible for what happened to her, while Jess feels the increasing need to move out of the city. While helping Jess pack, Ray notices pictures from a picnic thrown for law enforcement in which a young man is seen staring at Carolyn. Ray scans the photo and matches it to Anzor Marzin (Cole). D.A. Martin Morales (Molina) is reluctant to go after Marzin, fearing it would compromise the terrorism investigation. Officer Reggie Siefert (Kelly) brings in a suspect named Aban Ghazala (Amir Malaklou), who Ray realizes is not the killer.\nRay forces Siefert to admit that he set up Ghazala as a patsy to protect Marzin, Siefert's coveted informant in the terrorism probe. Ray and Detective Bumpy Willis (Norris) track down and arrest Marzin at Dodger Stadium. Claire argues with Ray over his methods while seemingly defending Marzin, saying he wasn't capable of the crime. Claire taunts Marzin, provoking him to expose himself and punch her, saying he's going to give Claire what Carolyn got. Ray beats Marzin, which leads to Morales ordering Marzin released. As Marzin gloats, an enraged Ray suggests they kill him before he gets away, but Jess refuses to go that route. After his release, Marzin's van is found burned, destroying all evidence against him.\nThirteen years later, Ray, now head of security for the New York Mets, returns to Los Angeles and reunites with Claire, now the D.A. Jess, who has been an anti-social shell since the loss of her daughter, is Claire's top investigator. Ray has found a man named Clay Beckwith (Cole), who he believes is Marzin living under an alias. The investigation eventually leads to a shootout with Beckwith in which Siefert is killed. Even though Beckwith and his men are arrested, Jess insists that Beckwith is not Marzin.\nWhen Ray and Claire pay a visit to Jess's isolated farmhouse, she confesses that she found and killed Marzin thirteen years previously, shortly after Ray left Los Angeles. Later, Ray follows Jess into her barn and discovers that Marzin is actually alive, having been imprisoned in a cage for over a decade. Marzin begs Ray to ask Jess to talk to him. Ray pulls out his gun and leaves it with Jess as he goes outside and starts digging a grave. Ray hears Jess shooting Marzin. The two meet each other with a sense of relief while Claire officially closes Carolyn's case.", "cast": "Chiwetel Ejiofor as Raymond \"Ray\" Kasten\nNicole Kidman as Claire Sloan\nJulia Roberts as Jessica \"Jess\" Cobb\nDean Norris as Bumpy Willis\nMichael Kelly as Reginald \"Reg\" Siefert\nAlfred Molina as Martin Morales\nZoe Graham as Carolyn Cobb\nLyndon Smith as Kit\nJoe Cole as Anzor Marzin / Clay Beckwith\nDonald Patrick Harvey as Fierro\nMark Famiglietti as Duty Sergeant Jacobs\nRoss Partridge as Ellis"}
