Despite the presence of scholars in many subjects throughout history, many geniuses have shown high achievements in only a single kind of activity.There is no scientifically precise definition of a genius, and the question of whether the notion itself has any real meaning has long been a subject of debate, although psychologists are converging on a definition that emphasizes creativity and eminent achievement. Usually, genius is associated with talent, but many authors (for example Cesare Lombroso and Arthur Schopenhauer) systematically distinguish these terms."}
