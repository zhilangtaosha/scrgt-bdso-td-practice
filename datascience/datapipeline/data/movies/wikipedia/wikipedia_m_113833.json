{"_movieID": "113833", "source": "wikipedia", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 14:53:30", "summary": "The Normal Heart is a largely autobiographical play by Larry Kramer.\nIt focuses on the rise of the HIV/AIDS crisis in New York City between 1981 and 1984, as seen through the eyes of writer/activist Ned Weeks, the gay founder of a prominent HIV advocacy group. Ned prefers loud public confrontations to the calmer, more private strategies favored by his associates, friends, and closeted lover Felix Turner. Their differences of opinion lead to frequent arguments that threaten to undermine their mutual goal.\nAfter a successful 1985 Off-Broadway production at The Public Theater, the play was revived in Los Angeles and London and again Off-Broadway in 2004.  A Broadway debut opened in April 2011."}
