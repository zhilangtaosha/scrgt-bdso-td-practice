Reflecting different national usages, cunt is described as a \"usually disparaging and obscene\" term for a woman or an \"offensive way to refer to a woman\" in the United States by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, but \"an unpleasant or stupid person\" in the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, and \"a contemptible person\" in the Macquarie Dictionary of Australian English. In Australia and New Zealand, it can also be used as a neutral or, when used with a positive qualifier (e.g., good, funny, clever), a positive way of referring to a person.The earliest known use of the word, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was as part of a placename of a London street, Gropecunt Lane, c.\u20091230. Use of the word as a term of abuse is relatively recent, dating from the late nineteenth century. The word appears not to have been taboo in the Middle Ages, but became taboo towards the end of the eighteenth century, and was then not generally admissible in print until the latter part of the twentieth century. The term has various derivative senses, including adjective and verb uses. Feminist writer and English professor Germaine Greer argues that cunt \"is one of the few remaining words in the English language with a genuine power to shock\"."}
