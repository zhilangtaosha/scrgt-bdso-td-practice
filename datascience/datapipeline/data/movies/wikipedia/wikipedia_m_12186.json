The film was written by, directed by, and stars Albert Brooks. It also stars Meryl Streep, Rip Torn, Lee Grant and Buck Henry.\nThe film was shot in and around Los Angeles, California. Despite its comedic overtones, Defending Your Life contains elements of drama and allegory.", "plot": "Daniel Miller (Albert Brooks), a Los Angeles advertising executive, dies in a car accident on his 39th birthday and is sent to the afterlife. He arrives in Judgment City, a Purgatory-like waiting area populated by the recently deceased of the western half of the United States, where he is to undergo the process of having his life on Earth judged. Daniel and the rest of the recently deceased are offered many Earth-like amenities and activities in the city while they undergo their judgment processes\u2014from all-you-can-eat restaurants (which cause no weight gain and serve the best food), to bowling alleys and comedy clubs.\nHis defense attorney, Bob Diamond (Rip Torn), explains to Daniel that people from Earth use so little of their brains (only three to five percent) that they spend most of their lives functioning on the basis of their fears. \"When you use more than five percent of your brain, you don't want to be on Earth, believe me,\" says Diamond. If the court determines that Daniel has conquered his fears, he will be sent on to the next phase of existence, where he will be able to use more of his brain and thus be able to experience more of what the universe has to offer. Otherwise, his soul will be reincarnated on Earth to live another life in another attempt at moving past his fears.\nDaniel's judgment process is presided over by two judges (played by Lillian Lehman and George D. Wallace). Diamond argues that Daniel should move onto the next phase. His formidable opponent is Lena Foster (Lee Grant). Diamond informs Daniel that she is known as \"the Dragon Lady\", and despite Diamond insisting the proceeding are \"not a trial\", there is clearly a contentious rivalry between the two attorneys. Each utilizes video-like footage from select days in the defendants' lives, shown to the judges to illustrate their case.\nDuring the procedure, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia (Meryl Streep), a woman who lived a seemingly perfect life of courage and generosity, especially compared to his. (She died after slipping on the ground and falling into her pool and drowning.) The proceedings do not go well for Daniel. Foster shows a series of episodes in which Daniel did not overcome his fears, as well as various other bad decisions and mishaps. Diamond attempts vigorously to portray Daniel's actions in a more positive light, other than one day in which he misses due to being \"trapped near the inner circle of thought\". Meanwhile following each days proceedings Danial and Julia spend time exploring Judgement City.\nOn the last day of the hearing, it seems the final nail in Daniel's coffin is when Foster plays footage of Daniel's previous night with Julia, in which he declines to spend the night with her, for what Foster believes is his same fear and lack of courage. It is ruled that Daniel will return to Earth. Meanwhile, Julia is judged worthy to move on. Before saying goodbye, Diamond comforts Daniel with the knowledge that the court is not infallible and just because Foster won it doesn't mean she's right. Daniel remains disappointed.\nDaniel finds himself strapped to a seat on a tram poised to return to Earth, when he spots Julia on a different tram. On impulse, he unstraps himself, escapes from the moving tram, and risks electrocution and injury to get to Julia. Unable to enter the tram, he clings precariously to the outside of the moving vehicle, banging on the door and trying to pry it open. The scene pulls back to show that the entire event is being watched by Foster, Diamond, and the judges in the chamber where Daniel's hearing took place.  A smiling Diamond remarks \"brave enough for you?\" Foster has no reply other than letting a bit of a smile slip as well, and one of the judges sends a message ordering the tram doors opened. Daniel and Julia reunite to the applause of the other passengers, and embrace as they are allowed to move on to the next phase of existence together.", "cast": "Albert Brooks - Daniel Miller\nMeryl Streep - Julia\nRip Torn - Bob Diamond\nLee Grant - Lena Foster\nBuck Henry - Dick Stanley, Daniel's substitute attorney\nGeorge D.
