Apocalypse's powers cause disturbances around the world, leading Xavier and Alex to consult with CIA operative Moira MacTaggert, who has been researching the legend of Apocalypse and tells them Apocalypse's origins; he was born millennia ago in Egypt as the first mutant, leading a team of mutant soldiers known as the Four Horsemen, while Apocalypse used his powers of destruction and rebuild.\nIn Communist Poland, Erik Lehnsherr uses his powers to save a co-worker during an earthquake, prompting local soldiers to capture him. When one accidentally kills his wife and daughter, Erik retaliates by slaughtering the group. Apocalypse takes Erik to Auschwitz and encourages him to use his powers; Erik destroys the camp and joins Apocalypse, who remotely accesses Cerebro, the device Xavier uses to locate mutants, and forces Xavier to make the global superpowers launch their entire nuclear arsenals into space to prevent interference with his plan. \nApocalypse and his Four Horsemen arrive at the mansion and kidnap Xavier. Attempting to stop them, Alex causes an explosion that destroys the mansion. Peter Maximoff arrives and uses his super-speed to evacuate the building, but Alex seemingly dies in the blast.

Isaac described Apocalypse as the \"creative-slash-destructive force of the Earth.\" He added, \"When things start to go awry, or when things seem like they're not moving towards evolution, [Apocalypse] destroys those civilizations.\" Isaac had to go through extensive makeup and prosthetics applications, and wore high-heeled boots to appear taller and a 40-pound suit.

Yeah. It's like an adoptive child or any kind of child who has a strange father trying to ... He knows who he is now so he is trying to find him. He's been searching for him.

Discussing her first day on X-Men: Apocalypse, Condor says, \"I was very new and it was my first role. I'd never been on a set before or in front of a camera, so I didn't know what to expect. The first day we shot scenes in an 80s-themed mall with hundreds of extras in 80s gear, plus crew and cameras. It was surreal...It's a lot easier when you have the costume, as that helps bring everything to life. She has her iconic yellow jacket, which is a staple. It's very bold and confident, like her. A lot of her costumes are super 80s. I also listened to music from the 80s and that helped.\"T\u00f3mas Lemarquis portrays Caliban, a mutant with the ability to sense and track other mutants.
