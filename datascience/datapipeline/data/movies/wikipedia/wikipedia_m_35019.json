Between trying to keep the family farm up and running and her job in the village shop, run by the slightly mad Mrs. Docherty, she also has three boisterous children to look after, Norman, Megsie and Vincent. When her children's two wealthy cousins, Cyril and Celia, also then come to live with them and start fighting with them, Isabel requires childcare help.\nWhen the magical Nanny McPhee arrives, the children at first do not listen and carry on fighting, which she soon puts a stop to with her magic. Meanwhile, Isabel's brother-in-law, Phil, has gambled away his half of the farm, and is being chased by two hired female assassins working for casino owner Mrs. Biggles. He desperately attempts to make Isabel sell her half of the farm, using mean and spiteful schemes to leave her no choice. The children find out one of his schemes and leads them to work together to fix it. Isabel takes the children on a picnic during which an ARP Warden, Mr. Docherty, warns them about bombs and how he imagines a pilot might accidentally release his bomb. At the end of the picnic, Uncle Phil delivers a telegram saying Isabel's husband was killed in action. Isabel and everyone else believes the telegram, but Norman says that he can \"feel it in his bones\" that his father is not dead. He tells this to Cyril, who at first says it is just because he is upset, but then agrees that Norman might be right, so the two boys ask Nanny McPhee to take them to the War Office in London, where Cyril and Celia's father works.\nThere, Nanny McPhee and the boys ask Cyril and Celia's father Lord Gray, who is very important in the War Office, what has happened to Mr. Green. At first Lord Gray sneers at Norman's disbelief at his father's death, but after Cyril blurts out that he knows his parents are getting a divorce, Lord Gray checks what has happened. While he is gone, Cyril tells Norman that he and Celia have been sent away because their parents will be splitting up, and Norman asks where Cyril and Celia will live. When Cyril replies that their parents only want to show each other off, Norman tells Cyril that he and Celia are welcome to live on the farm with the Greens. Lord Gray returns and tells Norman that his father is not dead, but is missing in action, and that there is no record of a telegram being sent to his mother. After the boys leave, Norman deduces that Uncle Phil forged the telegram.\nWhile the boys are at the War Office, Megsie, Celia and Vincent try to stop Isabel from signing the papers and selling the farm. Just as she is about to do so, a German pilot accidentally drops a huge bomb; it shakes everything but does not explode and is left sticking out of the barley field. When Nanny McPhee returns with Norman and Cyril, Norman accuses Phil of forgery, which he admits to, and Isabel handcuffs him to the stove. The children go out to watch Mr. Docherty dismantle the bomb, but he falls from the ladder. Megsie takes over, and succeeds with the help of the other children and Nanny McPhee's jackdaw, Mr. Edelweiss. After Nanny McPhee helps to harvest the barley with a little magic, saving Phil from Mrs. Biggles' hitwomen in the process, it is revealed that old Mrs. Docherty is in fact baby Agatha from the first film and that she remembers Nanny McPhee. As Nanny McPhee walks away from the now happy family, the children and Isabel chase after her, only to see Mr. Green, in army uniform with an injured arm, making his way to them. He runs to his family and they embrace.\nIn the mid-credits scene, Ellie, Vincent's elephant, is seen enjoying the magically operated Scratch-o-matic.", "cast": "Emma Thompson as Nanny McPhee, the magical nanny who changes the lives of the Green and Gray children.\nMaggie Gyllenhaal as Isabel Green (n\u00e9e Carrington), the frazzled mother of Norman, Megsie and Vincent.\nRhys Ifans as Phil Green, Norman, Megsie and Vincent's uncle, Rory's brother, and Isabel's brother-in-law, who tries to sell the farm because he gambled it away at a casino.\nAsa Butterfield as Norman Green, the eldest of the Green children.\nLil Woods as Megsie Green, the middle and only girl of the Green children.\nOscar Steer as Vincent Green, the youngest of the Green children.\nEros Vlahos as Cyril Gray, the spoiled cousin of Norman, Megsie and Vincent.
