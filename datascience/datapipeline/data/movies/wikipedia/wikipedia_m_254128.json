It grossed $474 million worldwide.", "plot": "Caltech seismologist Dr. Lawrence Hayes and his colleague Dr. Kim Park are at Hoover Dam testing a new earthquake predicting model when a nearby and previously unknown fault ruptures, triggering a 7.1 magnitude earthquake that collapses the dam; Park is killed shortly after rescuing a child. Hayes discovers that the entire San Andreas Fault is shifting and will soon cause a series of major earthquakes, potentially destroying cities along the fault line. He begins racing to warn the population of California alongside his students, Alexi and Phoebe, and reporter Serena Johnson.\nWhen a 9.1 magnitude earthquake devastates Los Angeles, Ray Gaines, a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot going through a divorce from his wife Emma, finds himself rescuing her. Their daughter, Blake, becomes trapped in the office of Emma's boyfriend, Daniel Riddick, when the same quake hits San Francisco, and is abandoned by him. Ben Taylor, a British engineer seeking employment, and his younger brother, Ollie, rescue Blake and they reach Chinatown, successfully calling her parents for help.\nRay and Emma attempt to reach San Francisco in Ray's helicopter until it suffers a gearbox failure, forcing them to make an emergency landing at a shopping mall in Bakersfield. Amid the chaos of looting, Ray steals a Ford F-150 to continue the journey. The pair encounter a couple broken down on the side of the road, shortly before the San Andreas Fault, which has reopened and blocked the road. Ray and Emma exchange the truck for an airplane the couple owns. As Blake, Ben, and Ollie attempt to reach Nob Hill to signal the pair after their previous meeting point at Coit Tower is engulfed in flames, Ray and Emma are forced to parachute into AT&T Park just before a 9.6 magnitude quake hits, becoming the new largest recorded earthquake in history.\nAs the quake subsides, having destroyed much of the city, Ray and Emma commandeer a boat to reach the group, only to realize a tsunami is approaching San Francisco Bay. They manage to cross the wave before it crests, barely avoiding a huge cargo ship caught up in the wave. The ship snaps the Golden Gate Bridge's center span in half, killing everyone on the bridge, including Daniel, and the wave swamps the ruined city, killing thousands more. Blake, Ben, and Ollie enter the Gate, a building whose construction Daniel had been overseeing, but are still caught by the wave. As the building begins to collapse, trapping Blake underwater, Ray dives in and brings her back to the boat alongside Ben and Ollie. Upon being resuscitated, Blake happily reunites with her family. \nThe survivors regroup at a relief camp, where the reconciled Ray and Emma talk about their future. On the remains of the Golden Gate Bridge an American flag unfolds, giving hope that the city will recover and rebuild, as rescue vehicles descend on the radically altered landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area, which has now extended from San Jose to Santa Cruz, turning the San Francisco Peninsula into an island.", "cast": "Dwayne Johnson as Raymond \"Ray\" Gaines, a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot\nCarla Gugino as Emma Gaines, Ray's estranged wife\nAlexandra Daddario as Blake Gaines, Ray and Emma's daughter\nArabella Morton as Mallory Gaines, Ray and Emma's other daughter and Blake's sister, who drowned in a rafting accident\nHugo Johnstone-Burt as Ben Taylor, an English engineer and Blake's love interest\nArt Parkinson as Ollie Taylor, Ben's younger brother\nIoan Gruffudd as Daniel Riddick, Emma's boyfriend and owner of a civil engineering firm\nPaul Giamatti as Dr. Lawrence Hayes, a Caltech seismologist\nArchie Panjabi as Serena Johnson, a news reporter\nWill Yun Lee as Dr. Kim Park, a Caltech seismologist, and Lawrence's research partner and closest friend\nAlec Utgoff as Alexi, Lawrence's student\nMarissa Neitling as Phoebe, Lawrence's student\nKylie Minogue as Susan Riddick, Daniel's sister\nTodd Williams as Marcus Crowlings, a fellow Los Angeles Fire Department member\nMatt Gerald as Harrison Rhodes, a fellow Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot\nColton Haynes as Joby O'Leary, a fellow Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot"}
