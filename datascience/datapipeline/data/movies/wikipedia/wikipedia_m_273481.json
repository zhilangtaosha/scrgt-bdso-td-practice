Following the raid, Kate's boss recommends her for a Department of Justice special joint task force, overseen by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and the secretive Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro), to apprehend the Sonora Cartel lieutenant Manuel D\u00edaz (Bernardo Saracino). Assured that the task force will bring D\u00edaz and those responsible for the safehouse incident to justice, Kate enlists in the operation. \nThe team travels in force to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, to extradite D\u00edaz's brother and henchman Guillermo D\u00edaz (Edgar Arreola). To preempt an ambush, the team kills several Mexican cartel gunmen at the public border checkpoint, shocking Kate. Alejandro tortures Guillermo and learns that the cartel uses a tunnel to smuggle drugs into the U.S.\nReggie and Kate begin to question the task force's illegal and seemingly inexplicable methods. Finally, Matt reveals that the objective is not to apprehend D\u00edaz, as originally suggested, but to disrupt his drug operations to such a degree that D\u00edaz will be summoned back to Mexico by his boss, the elusive Sonora Cartel drug lord Fausto Alarc\u00f3n. By following D\u00edaz, they plan to bring Alarc\u00f3n to justice.\nTo disrupt D\u00edaz's cash flow, the team raids a bank used by his money launderers. Kate and Reggie want to use their findings from the raid to mount a legal case against D\u00edaz, but are ordered to stand down, so as to not jeopardize the operation \u2014 much to their frustration. While commiserating at a bar, Reggie introduces Kate to Ted (Jon Bernthal), a friend and Phoenix police officer. Kate and Ted go to her apartment, but as they become passionate, Kate realizes Ted is working with the cartel. In the ensuing struggle, Ted begins strangling Kate, but Alejandro suddenly appears and subdues him. Alejandro and Matt reveal that they used her as bait, knowing the cartel would target her after she foolishly allowed herself to be seen at the bank raid. Alejandro and Matt coerce Ted into revealing the names of other officers working for D\u00edaz.\nThey soon learn that D\u00edaz is being recalled to Mexico, as they had hoped. Kate questions the good news, pointing out that they have no jurisdiction in Mexico. Matt advises Kate that her and Reggie\u2019s involvement in the operation is simply a technical necessity, as working with U.S. law officers grants the CIA legal auspice to participate in the operation. Angered, Reggie advises that he and Kate leave the task force, but she insists on joining a task force raid on the tunnel to learn more about the operation's true nature. At the Mexican end of the tunnel, Kate witnesses Alejandro kidnapping one of D\u00edaz's drug mules, a corrupt Mexican police officer named Silvio (Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez). Kate attempts to arrest Alejandro, but he purposely shoots her in the bulletproof vest to incapacitate her, before driving off with Silvio. Realizing that Alejandro is operating illegally with the task force's support, and that there was never any intention of bringing Alarc\u00f3n and D\u00edaz to justice through legal channels, Kate confronts Matt.\nMatt explains that they are attempting to return to a time when a single cartel, Medell\u00edn, ran the drug trade. This monopoly gave the U.S. more control. Alejandro, a hitman who worked for Medell\u00edn, was brought on to topple the Sonora Cartel by assassinating Alarc\u00f3n, thus reducing cartel competition. Alejandro's motive is also personal: Alarc\u00f3n had ordered the murder of Alejandro's wife and daughter back when Alejandro was a prosecutor in Juarez. In Mexico, Alejandro forces Silvio to drive him to D\u00edaz, kills Silvio, and then forces D\u00edaz to continue to Alarc\u00f3n. Reaching Alarc\u00f3n's estate, Alejandro kills D\u00edaz, the guards, and the entire Alarc\u00f3n family, including his wife and two sons.\nAlejandro appears in Kate's apartment and forces her, at gunpoint, to sign a statement declaring the operation maintained legal methods. As he leaves, she aims her pistol at him, but cannot bring herself to pull the trigger.\nIn Nogales, Sonora, Silvio's widow watches her son's soccer game. The game is briefly interrupted by the sound of gunfire, before continuing."}
