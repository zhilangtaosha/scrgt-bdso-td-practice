The novel was named Best Novel of the Year in Chile in 1982, and Allende received the country's Panorama Literario award. The House of the Spirits has been translated into over 37 languages.The book was first conceived by Allende when she received news that her 100-year-old grandfather was dying. She began to write him a letter that ultimately became the manuscript of The House of the Spirits.The story details the life of the Trueba family, spanning four generations, and tracing the post-colonial social and political upheavals of Chile \u2013 though the country's name, and the names of figures closely paralleling historical ones, such as \"the President\" or \"the Poet\", are never explicitly given.
