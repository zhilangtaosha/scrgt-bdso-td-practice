Don Luis is incensed that Restrepo thinks he can leave. Don Luis sends his henchman Marco and a group of killers to kill Restrepo and his family. Fabio gives his ten-year-old daughter Cataleya a SmartMedia computer memory card with the information on Don Luis' business and tells her it's her \"passport\"; he also gives her the address of her uncle Emilio, a criminal in Chicago, who will take care of her. The last thing he gives her is something that he says will keep her safe: his mother's cattleya orchid necklace. After saying their goodbyes, Fabio and his wife Alicia leave to battle Marco and his men but both are gunned down as Cataleya watches. Marco tries to manipulate her into giving him the disk, but Cataleya refuses and escapes, after stabbing Marco in the hand. She makes it to the U.S. Embassy and gives the information in exchange for a passport and passage to the United States. She escapes from the airport and takes a bus to Chicago. Once she finds Emilio, Cataleya asks him to train her as a killer.\nFifteen years later, a grown Cataleya has become an accomplished assassin. Her uncle serves as her broker, providing her with contracts. With each murder she commits, she leaves her signature, the Cattleya flower, which is a message to her ultimate target, Don Luis, that she is coming for him. After learning about this Colombian orchid, FBI agent James Ross can now link this case to more than twenty other cases. As a last resort, the FBI decides to inform the public about Cataleya's calling card. Don Luis, who is currently in a witness protection program overseen by CIA agent Steve Richard, realizes that Fabio's daughter is in the U.S. and orders Marco and his operatives to find her.\nCataleya uses every means at her disposal, including death threats to law enforcement officials, to find where Don Luis is hiding and avenge her family's death."}
