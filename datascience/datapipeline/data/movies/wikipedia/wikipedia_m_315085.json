The concert was put together by HBO, Chase, and Starbucks.\nPerformers included Bruce Springsteen, The Black Keys, Rihanna, Eminem, Zac Brown Band, Jennifer Hudson, Carrie Underwood, Metallica, Dave Grohl, and Jessie J.\nThe show featured onstage hosts Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, George Lopez, John Oliver, and Bob Woodruff. There were special tributes by Tom Hanks, Will Smith, Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Oprah Winfrey, and Reese Witherspoon.\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority expected as many as 800,000 attendees to the 2014 event. This estimate was based on a permit filed with the United States Park Police.  In actuality, newspapers reported that about 100,000 people attended. A couple of the performances drew questions as to their propriety for the event: one for \"Fortunate Son\" on its lyrics and one for Eminem on his profanity-laced tribute to Veterans Day."}
