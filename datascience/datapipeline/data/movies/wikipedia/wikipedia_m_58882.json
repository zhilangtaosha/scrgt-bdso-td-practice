In her introduction to the novel, See writes that Lily, the narrator, was born on June 5, 1824\u2014\"the fifth day of the sixth month of the third year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign\". The novel begins in 1903, when Lily is 80 years old. It continues on to tell the story of her life from birth, childhood, marriage, and old age.  During her lifetime, Lily lives through the reigns of four emperors of the Qing dynasty: Daoguang (1820\u20131850); Xianfeng (1850\u20131861); Tongzhi (1861\u20131875); and Guangxu  (1875\u20131908).\nThe University of Southern California China historian Charlotte Furth wrote that Western readers think of Chinese women simply as victims and focus on such problems as footbinding and arranged marriages, but that Lisa See's historical novels \"follow the best feminist scholarship on women in the Ming-Qing period by tackling these stereotypes.\" In Snowflower and the Secret Fan and in Peony in Love, See \"asks readers to imagine how a few such women might have found voices of their own within, rather than in opposition to, the Confucian social order, and how they found ways to self-fulfillment without flouting their culture\u2019s fundamental values.\" The novel received an honorable mention from the Asian/Pacific American Awards for Literature.\n\n"}
