Maury Henry Biddle Paul is credited with coining the phrase \"caf\u00e9 society\" in 1915. Lucius Beebe created the term \"chromium mist\" for the caf\u00e9 society lifestyle he chronicled in his weekly column, This New York, for the New York Herald Tribune during the 1920s and 1930s.\nMembers attended each other's private dinners and balls, and took holidays in exotic locations or at elegant resorts. In the United States, caf\u00e9 society came to the fore with the end of Prohibition in December 1933 and the rise of photojournalism to describe the set of people who tended to do their entertaining semi-publicly\u2014in restaurants and night clubs\u2014and who would include among them movie stars and sports celebrities. Some of the American night clubs and New York City restaurants frequented by the denizens of caf\u00e9 society included the 21 Club, El Morocco, Restaurant Larue, and the Stork Club."}
