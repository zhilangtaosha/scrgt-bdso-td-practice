Exact time when evening begins and ends (as with night) depends on location and varies throughout the year. Its earliest part of a short period is evening twilight. The word 'evening' may be casually used to include the last waning afternoon shortly before sunset.   There can be no precise definition in terms of clock time, but it is casually considered to start around 5 P.M. or 6 P.M. and to last until night or bed-time."}
