Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to 2015's Ant-Man and the twentieth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Peyton Reed and written by the writing teams of Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari. It stars Rudd as Lang and Evangeline Lilly as Van Dyne, alongside Michael Pe\u00f1a, Walton Goggins, Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer, Tip \"T.I.\" Harris, David Dastmalchian, Hannah John-Kamen, Abby Ryder Fortson, Randall Park, Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, and Michael Douglas. In Ant-Man and the Wasp, the titular pair work with Hank Pym to retrieve Janet van Dyne from the quantum realm.\nTalks for a sequel to Ant-Man began shortly after that film was released. Ant-Man and the Wasp was officially announced in October 2015, with Rudd and Lilly returning to reprise their roles. A month later, Ant-Man director Reed was officially set to return; he was excited to develop the film from the beginning after joining the first film later in the process and also to introduce Hope van Dyne as the Wasp in this film, insisting on treating Lang and her as equals. Filming took place from August to November 2017, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, as well as Metro Atlanta, San Francisco, Savannah, Georgia and Hawaii.\nAnt-Man and the Wasp had its world premiere in Hollywood on June 25, 2018 and was released on July 6, 2018, in the United States in IMAX and 3D. The film was a critical and commercial success, receiving praise for its levity, humor and performances, particularly those of Rudd and Lilly, and grossed over $622 million worldwide.", "plot": "Two years after Scott Lang was placed under house arrest due to his involvement with the Avengers, in violation of the Sokovia Accords, Hank Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne briefly manage to open a tunnel to the quantum realm. They believe Pym's wife Janet van Dyne might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become quantumly entangled with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her.\nWith only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet despite the strained relationship they have due to Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Believing the message from Janet to be confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer Sonny Burch, who has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym's research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"ghost\", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase.\nPym reluctantly visits his estranged former partner Bill Foster with Hope and Lang. Foster helps them locate the lab, where the ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father Elihas, another of Pym's former partners, died along with his wife during the experiment that caused Ava's unstable state. Foster reveals that Ava is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition, and they plan to cure her using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and escapes with Hope, Lang, and the lab.\nOpening a stable version of the tunnel, Pym, Hope, and Lang are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Using a truth serum, Burch learns the trio's location from Lang's business partners Luis, Dave, and Kurt, and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Lang, who rushes home before Woo can see him violating his house arrest. Pym and Hope are arrested by the FBI, allowing Ava to take the lab.\nLang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but Burch and his men also attack Lang and Hope which allows Ava to begin forcibly taking Janet's energy. Luis, Dave, and Kurt help incapacitate Burch and his men so that Lang and Hope can stop Ava. Pym and Janet return safely from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her.\nLang returns home once again, in time for a now suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. Ava and Foster go into hiding. In a mid-credits scene, Pym, Lang, Hope, and Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to help Ava remain stable. While Lang is in the quantum realm doing this, the other three disintegrate.", "cast": "Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man: A former petty criminal who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength. Following the events of Captain America: Civil War, in which Lang escapes from the Raft prison, director Peyton Reed said that \"he's a fugitive in most of the first Ant-Man movie. He's just a bigger fugitive now.\" Rudd was interested in Lang being a regular person rather than \"innately heroic or super\", and to be driven by his desire to be a responsible parent.\nEvangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp: The daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne who is handed down a similar suit and the Wasp mantle from her mother. The writers were excited to properly introduce the character as the Wasp, showing her \"power set, how she fights, and what are the injustices that matter to her\". Lilly felt the character has \"incredible satisfaction\" in becoming the Wasp, \"something that she has been waiting for her whole life, which is essentially an affirmation from her father\". Her relationship with Lang is more complicated than in the first film, and includes anger towards his actions during Captain America: Civil War. Lilly felt it was important that Hope \"be an extremely empathetic and compassionate person\" and \"to always push for feminine qualities to be apparent when she is dealing with situations\". In her fight sequences, Lilly wanted to move away from the more masculine Muay Thai and MMA-style of fighting she learned for the first film, noting that Hope moves differently than a man, so her fights should have \"elegance, grace and femininity\" with \"a signature style\" young girls could enjoy and emulate. Lilly worked with the writers to help ensure Hope was able to \"represent a modern woman\" without becoming the stereotype of a motherly figure. Madeleine McGraw portrays a young Hope van Dyne.\nMichael Pe\u00f1a as Luis: Lang's former cellmate and a member of his X-Con Security crew. There was less opportunity for Pe\u00f1a to improvise compared to the first film, where he and Rudd were still developing the character during filming. The creative team wanted to feature another scene of Luis \"riffing a long story\" as he did in the first film, but did not want to repeat themselves; they were able to take a different approach by giving the character truth serum in the scene for this film.\nWalton Goggins as Sonny Burch: A \"low-level criminal-type\" who seeks to obtain Pym's technology for sale on the black market.\nBobby Cannavale as Jim Paxton: A police officer and husband to Lang's ex-wife Maggie.\nJudy Greer as Maggie: Lang's former wife.\nTip \"T.I.\" Harris as Dave: A member of Lang's X-Con Security crew.\nDavid Dastmalchian as Kurt: A member of Lang's X-Con Security crew.\nHannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr / Ghost: A woman with molecular instability, who can phase through objects; she is only considered a \"villain\" because her attempts at survival clash with the heroes' goals. The character is traditionally portrayed as male in the comics, but the creative team believed that the character's gender was irrelevant to its portrayal, and felt casting a woman would be more interesting; it also allowed them to continue the theme of fathers and daughters seen with other characters in the film. John-Kamen enjoyed this \"blank-slate\" aspect, allowing her to mold the character as her own. Producer Stephen Broussard said that they wanted to cast a lesser-known actress to help maintain the mystery of the character, and John-Kamen \"blew us away\". RaeLynn Bratten portrays a young Ava Starr.\nAbby Ryder Fortson as Cassie: The daughter of Lang and Maggie.\nRandall Park as Jimmy Woo: An FBI agent and Lang's parole officer.\nMichelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne: The original Wasp who is lost in the quantum realm. She is Pym's wife and Hope's mother. Pfeiffer was Reed's dream casting for the role since his time working on the first film, and he ensured that he received her input on the character. He noted that the character has spent 30 years in the quantum realm, so there is a question regarding how that has affected her. Producer Kevin Feige explained that the character ages over those 30 years even though time works differently in the quantum realm to avoid any \"sci-fi weirdness\" that could take away from the emotional reunions with Pym and Hope in the film. Michelle Pfeiffer was de-aged to portray young Janet van Dyne, with Hayley Lovitt acting as a reference double. Lovitt had portrayed Janet in the first film, before Pfeiffer's involvement in the franchise, with Reed explaining that she had been cast for the first film due to her \"saucer-like, Michelle Pfeiffer eyes.\"\nLaurence Fishburne as Bill Foster: An old friend of Pym who was once his assistant on Project Goliath. Fishburne had approached Marvel about joining the MCU, pitching them a few ideas for whom he could portray, before Marvel offered him the role of Foster in the film. Despite having already portrayed Perry White for the DC Extended Universe, Fishburne said that he had always fantasized about being in an MCU film, admitting that he considered himself a \"Marvel guy\". Reed likened the rivalry between Foster and Pym to that of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and wanted an actor who can go \"toe-to-toe\" with Michael Douglas. Laurence Fishburne was de-aged to portray young Ben Foster, with Langston Fishburne, Laurence's son, acting as a reference double.\nMichael Douglas as Hank Pym: A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, entomologist, and physicist who became the original Ant-Man after discovering the subatomic particles that make the transformation possible. Pym has grown a lot closer to his daughter Hope since the first film, and according to Feige he has \"that joy of fatherhood\" in watching her become a superhero in her own right. Reed was attracted to the \"morally dubious\" decisions Pym sometimes makes. Michael Douglas was de-aged to portray young Hank Pym, with Dax Griffin acting as a reference double, having done so for the first film as well.Additionally Stan Lee, co-creator of the titular heroes, has a cameo in the film as a man whose car gets shrunk by accident. Michael Cerveris appears as Ava's father Elihas Starr while Riann Steele plays his wife Catherine. Tim Heidecker and Brian Huskey appear in cameos as a whale boat captain named Daniel Gooobler and a teacher at Cassie's school, respectively. Sonny Burch's team of men includes Divian Ladwa as Uzman, Goran Kosti\u0107 as Anitolov, and Rob Archer as Knox, while Sean Kleier portrays Stoltz, Burch's FBI inside man and Jimmy Woo's subordinate. Tom Scharpling and Jon Wurster of The Best Show make brief appearances as Burch's SUV drivers."}
