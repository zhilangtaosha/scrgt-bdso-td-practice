The film tells an alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's leadership, one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), a young French Jewish cinema proprietor and the other by a team of Jewish American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt). Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel tracking down Raine's group and who is connected to Shosanna's past. The film's title was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's macaroni combat film The Inglorious Bastards (1978).\nTarantino wrote the script in 1998, but struggled with the ending and chose instead to direct the two-part film Kill Bill. After directing Death Proof in 2007, Tarantino returned to work on Inglourious Basterds. A co-production of the United States and Germany, the film began principal photography in October 2008 and was filmed in Germany and France with a $70 million production budget. It premiered on May 20, 2009, at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival, and received a wide release in theaters in the United States and Europe in August 2009 by The Weinstein Company and Universal Pictures.\nInglourious Basterds grossed over $321 million in theaters worldwide, making it Tarantino's highest-grossing film until the release of Django Unchained (2012); it remains his second-highest-grossing film. It received multiple awards and nominations, among them eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. For his role as Landa, Waltz won the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor Award, as well as the BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, Critics' Choice, Golden Globe, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.", "plot": "In 1941, SS Colonel Hans Landa interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier La Padite about the whereabouts of the last unaccounted-for Jewish family in the area, the Dreyfus family. Landa suspects that they are hiding under the floor, and in exchange for the Germans agreeing to leave his family alone for the rest of the war, La Padite somberly confirms it. Landa orders his SS soldiers to shoot through the floorboards, killing all but one of the Dreyfus family; Shosanna, the daughter, escapes. As she runs, Col. Landa decides not to shoot her.\nThree years later, Lieutenant Aldo Raine of the First Special Service Force rounds up and recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the Basterds, a militia who spread fear among the German soldiers by killing and scalping them. The Basterds include Donny \"The Bear Jew\" Donowitz and Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, the latter a rogue German soldier who murdered thirteen Gestapo officers. In Germany, Adolf Hitler interviews a young German soldier, Private Butz, the only survivor of a Basterd attack on his squad, who reveals the details of the attack and that Raine carved the Nazi swastika into Butz's forehead with a knife so he could never hide that he served in the German Heer.\nShosanna is now living in Paris and operating a cinema under the name \"Emmanuelle Mimieux\". She meets Fredrick Zoller, a German war hero who killed 250 soldiers in a single battle, who is starring in a Nazi propaganda film, Stolz der Nation (Nation's Pride). Infatuated with Shosanna, Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the premiere of the film at her cinema. Landa interrogates Shosanna about how she acquired the cinema at such a young age, while giving hints that he may know who she is, but ultimately forgets his most important question and leaves her alone. Shosanna plots with her Afro-French lover and projectionist Marcel to kill the Nazi leaders attending the premiere by setting the cinema ablaze. Unknown to Shosanna, British Royal Marine Lieutenant Archie Hicox is planning an attack at the premiere with the Basterds.\nHicox goes to a tavern with Stiglitz and Basterd Wilhelm Wicki to meet an undercover agent, the German film star Bridget von Hammersmark. Hicox draws the attention of Wehrmacht Sergeant Wilhelm and Gestapo major Dieter Hellstrom with his unusual accent and mannerisms. Discovered, Stiglitz and the Basterds open fire, after which everyone in the tavern is killed in the ensuing firefight except Sergeant Wilhelm and von Hammersmark, who is wounded. Raine arrives and negotiates with Wilhelm for von Hammersmark's release, but she shoots Wilhelm when he lowers his guard. Raine, believing von Hammersmark set Hicox and his men up, tortures von Hammersmark, who convinces him that she is not a spy and reveals that Hitler will attend the film premiere. He decides to continue the mission.\nLanda investigates the aftermath at the tavern and finds one of von Hammersmark's shoes and a napkin with her signature. At the premiere, two of the Basterds, Omar Ulmer and Donny, join Raine in posing as Italians, hoping to fool the Germans unfamiliar with the language. However, Landa, who speaks fluent Italian, converses briefly with the Basterds before sending Donowitz and Ulmer to their seats. He takes von Hammersmark to a private room, verifies that the shoe from the tavern fits her, then strangles her to death. Raine and another Basterd, Smithson \"The Little Man\" Utivich, are taken prisoner, but Landa has Raine contact his superior with the OSS and cuts a deal: he will allow the mission to proceed in exchange for immunity.\nDuring the screening, Zoller slips away to the projection room to see Shosanna. After she rejects his advances, he becomes aggressive. She pretends to acquiesce, then pulls a pistol and shoots him. Zoller, wounded, raises his pistol and shoots her before they both die. As Stolz der Nation reaches its climax, spliced-in footage of Shosanna tells the audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Marcel, having locked the doors of the cinema, ignites a pile of flammable nitrate film behind the screen as Shosanna's image laughs and goes up in flames. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the box containing Hitler and Goebbels, killing them. They then fire their submachine guns into the crowd until the bombs go off, killing everyone in the theater. \nLanda and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender before Raine shoots the radio operator and carves a swastika into Landa's forehead, professing it to be his \"masterpiece\"."}
