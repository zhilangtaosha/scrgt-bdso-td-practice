Mary Kawena Pukui wrote that the \"first expression\" of aloha was between a parent and child. The word has become a part of the English vocabulary in an awkward misuse. The Oxford English Dictionary defined the word as a \"greeting\" like \"welcome\" and \"farewell\" using a number of examples dating back as far as 1798 and up to 1978 where it was defined as a substitute for welcome.Lorrin Andrews wrote the first Hawaiian dictionary, called A Dictionary of the Hawaiian Language. In it he describes aloha as \"A word expressing different feelings; love, affection, gratitude, kindness, pity, compassion, grief, the modern common salutation at meeting; parting\". Mary Kawena Pukui and Samuel Hoyt Elbert's Hawaiian Dictionary: Hawaiian-English, English-Hawaiian also contains a similar definition. Anthropologist Francis Newton states that \"Aloha is a complex and profound sentiment. Such emotions defy definition\". Anna Wierzbicka concludes that the term has \"no equivalent in English\".The state of Hawai\u2019i introduced an  \"Aloha Spirit law\" in 1986, which mandates  that city and state employees greet the public by using the words Aloha and Mahalo."}
