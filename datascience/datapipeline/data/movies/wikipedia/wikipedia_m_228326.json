They strike a wager: if Mar\u00eda marries Manolo, Xibalba will no longer interfere in mortal affairs, but if she marries Joaqu\u00edn, La Muerte and Xibalba will swap realms. However, Xibalba cheats by giving Joaqu\u00edn his Medal of Everlasting Life, which grants the wearer invincibility.\nYears later, Joaqu\u00edn has become a hero with the Medal's aid, but Manolo's musical aspirations are suppressed by his father Carlos, who trains him to be a bullfighter in their family tradition. At Manolo's first bullfight he defeats the bull but refuses to kill it, dismaying Carlos and the crowd but impressing Mar\u00eda. That night, Mar\u00eda is pressured by her father and mayor, General Ramiro Posada, to marry Joaqu\u00edn for his protection from the Bandit King Chakal. Mar\u00eda and Manolo both profess their love before dawn but are interrupted when Xibalba sends his dual-headed snake staff, who bites her and sends her into a coma. Devastated by Mar\u00eda's apparent death, Manolo allows Xibalba to kill him, believing he will be reunited with Mar\u00eda in death.\nIn the Land of the Remembered, Manolo reunites with his mother and his ancestral family. They travel to La Muerte's castle, discovering Xibalba, now the ruler of the realm, who explains the bet and smugly reveals that Mar\u00eda didn\u2019t die because she was only bitten once and therefore survived. However, Manolo was bitten twice and died. Furious but determined to return to Mar\u00eda, Manolo travels to the Cave of Souls to reach La Muerte. Inside, he meets the Candle Maker, the overseer of mortal lives and the Book of Life's keeper. The Candle Maker sees that Manolo's story in the Book of Life is blank and can be rewritten by himself, so he takes them to the Land of the Forgotten. They find La Muerte at Xibalba's castle and expose his cheating. Furious, La Muerte lectures Xibalba before offering a new wager at Manolo's request: Manolo's life will be returned if he completes a challenge of Xibalba's choosing, but if he fails, he will be forgotten and Xibalba will keep both realms. Xibalba sets Manolo against a giant bull skeleton made from the skeletons of every bull slain by the Sanchez family, believing that to be his greatest fear.\nMeanwhile, Mar\u00eda has been awakened from her coma, learns of Manolo's death, and accepts Joaqu\u00edn's proposal. Their wedding is interrupted by Chakal, who leads his army to San Angel to find the Medal, which was previously his. Chakal kills Carlos, who arrives in the Land of the Remembered in time to see Manolo's fight. Manolo, realizing his fear is actually of being himself, refuses to fight and instead sings an apology to the bull, appeasing it and touching everyone present. Impressed, the deities resurrect Manolo and send him and his family to San Angel to protect it. Manolo is knocked unconscious when Chakal destructs himself, but he is protected by the Medal, which Joaqu\u00edn had slipped him earlier. Joaqu\u00edn returns it to Xibalba and resolves to be a true hero, while Manolo and Mar\u00eda are happily married as Xibalba and La Muerte reconcile.\nIn the present, Mary Beth finishes the story, and the amazed children leave the museum. Mary Beth and a security guard reveal themselves to be La Muerte and Xibalba in disguise. The Candle Maker appears and encourages the audience to write their own story."}
