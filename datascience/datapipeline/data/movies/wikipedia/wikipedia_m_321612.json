Her lengthy version was abridged, rewritten, and published first by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1756 in Magasin des enfants (Children's Collection) and by Andrew Lang in the Blue Fairy Book of his Fairy Book series in 1889, to produce the version(s) most commonly retold. It was influenced by some earlier stories, such as \"Cupid and Psyche\", The Golden Ass written by  Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis in the 2nd century AD, and \"The Pig King\", an Italian fairytale published by Giovanni Francesco Straparola in The Facetious Nights of Straparola.Variants of the tale are known across Europe. In France, for example, Z\u00e9mire and Azor is an operatic version of the story, written by Marmontel and composed by Gr\u00e9try in 1771, which had enormous success well into the 19th century; it is based on the second version of the tale. Amour pour amour (Love for love), by Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chauss\u00e9e, is a 1742 play based on de Villeneuve's version. According to researchers at universities in Durham and Lisbon, the story originated around 4,000 years ago."}
