{"_movieID": "17578", "source": "wikipedia", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 14:07:16", "summary": "The Adventures of Tintin (French: Les Aventures de Tintin [lez\u203fav\u0251\u0303ty\u0281 d\u0259 t\u025b\u0303t\u025b\u0303]) is a series of 24 comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, who wrote under the pen name Herg\u00e9. The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Herg\u00e9's birth in 1907, Tintin had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies, and had been adapted for radio, television, theatre, and film.\nThe series first appeared in French on 10 January 1929 in Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me (The Little Twentieth), a youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle (The Twentieth Century). The success of the series saw the serialised strips published in Belgium's leading newspaper Le Soir (The Evening) and spun into a successful Tintin magazine. In 1950, Herg\u00e9 created Studios Herg\u00e9, which produced the canonical versions of ten Tintin albums.\nThe series is set during a largely realistic 20th century. Its hero is Tintin, a courageous young Belgian reporter and adventurer. He is aided by his faithful dog Snowy (Milou in the original French edition). Other protagonists include the brash and cynical Captain Haddock and the intelligent but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (French: Professeur Tournesol), as well as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (French: Dupont et Dupond) and the opera diva Bianca Castafiore.\nThe series has been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herg\u00e9's signature ligne claire (\"clear line\") style. Its plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, action, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories feature slapstick humour, offset by dashes of sophisticated satire and political or cultural commentary."}
