He washes his face in a sink and puts on his glasses. Walking through a crowded street, he is briefly accosted by a group of thugs, whom he ignores. Greeted by Ella, he gives her the book The Power and the Glory to read, a book that he enjoyed. Leaving, Sapper goes to a market to sell leeches he has farmed, being paid $3,000, which is $1,000 less than Sapper needs. After leaving the market, Sapper sees Ella and her Mother about to be sexually assaulted by the group of thugs he had earlier ignored. Angered, Sapper proceeds to savagely beat the group with seemingly superhuman strength and resilience, inadvertently killing most of them. Sapper leaves the scene, having dropped his identification papers. A spectator, having watched Sapper earlier, calls the LAPD to inform them that he thinks he's found a rogue \"skin-job\".", "cast": "Dave Bautista as Sapper Morton, a Nexus-8 replicant.\nGerard Miller as Salt\nGaia Ottman as Ella\nBj\u00f6rn Freiberg as spectator\nOrion Ben as mother\nAdam Savage as shop patron (cameo)"}
