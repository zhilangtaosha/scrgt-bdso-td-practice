Although several other revenue streams also generate revenue (such as theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising) theatrical box office earnings take prominence, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. The success at the box office is measured in a number of ways, and these look at both the total gross as well as the speed with which that gross is attained. This list focuses on the latter. Included on this list are charts showing the films that reached certain milestones in the fastest time. All charts are ranked first by the number of days they took to reach the milestone, and second by their total gross on the day they exceeded the milestone. The charts are not adjusted for inflation, which does erode the achievements of earlier films."}
