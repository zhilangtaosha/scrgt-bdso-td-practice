The film, starring Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irvine, and Ronny Cox, was released on April 17, 2015, by Roadside Attractions.\n\n", "plot": "Ruthless tycoon and trophy collector John Madec flaunts his $500,000 all-terrain vehicle in a small New Mexico town, buying off the local sheriff to bag an endangered desert bighorn sheep. The sheriff solicits the young but experienced tracker Ben to guide the malevolent Madec an hour outside of town into the canyon country of Shiprock. Madec taunts Ben over his love interest, who has gone away to Colorado on a college swimming scholarship after being gifted a gun that Ben taught her to shoot.  When Ben asks to see the permit to hunt the endangered bighorn, Madec offers a wad of cash, which the stunned Ben begrudgingly accepts after Madec supplements his initial offer even further. \nLater, when Madec \u2014 with a shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later philosophy \u2014 accidentally shoots an old prospector, Ben insists that they must report it as an accident. Madec on the other hand puts another bullet from Ben's gun into the corpse, and after explaining how he can now blackmail Ben with questions of who was the actual killer, offers Ben a deal:  Madec will put him through college with a finance major and give him a $300,000 dollar-a-year job in return for his complicity in covering up the crime.\nWhen Ben picks up his emergency transponder, Madec destroys it and berates Ben for breaking the deal. Madec then threatens Ben with his high-powered rifle and orders him to strip all of his clothes and shoes, forcing him to wander out in the desert to die of dehydration and exposure.\nMadec plans to report that Ben went mad, shot the prospector, and wandered off into the barren horizon alone. Madec is certain Ben cannot survive, as they are in the hot desert 45 miles from the nearest town. To ensure this, Madec watches Ben from a distance, using the scope from his rifle. Ben finds enough water inside of a barrel to survive until Madec shoots the barrel. Ben then hides in the dead prospector's subterranean lair, but Madec blows it up with the prospector's dynamite stash, with Ben managing to escape before it explodes with a 'treasure map' of Charlies, whom Ben vows will not die without justice.\nBy sunset, Ben uses the map to find a wrist-brace slingshot and some marbles amongst a buried box of Charlie's personal effects. Ben heads for a hidden grotto of water that he and his girlfriend had swam in, only to find it dried up as his sun-burnt body now freezes in the desert night. Madec keeps watch with his vehicle's high-powered floodlights as Ben eventually outsmarts Madec to overcome him with the slingshot.\nBack in town, Madec escapes from police custody during a bathroom break to board a helicopter that he solicited using his one phone call. Ben goes to his girlfriend and promises not to leave her side again. An armed Madec then sneaks into their house as Ben and his girlfriend sleep and confronts them, but Ben's girlfriend shoots Madec using the same gun Ben gave to her. Still alive, Madec is then killed by Ben as the screen fades to black.", "cast": "Michael Douglas as John Madec\nJeremy Irvine as Ben\nRonny Cox as Sheriff J.
