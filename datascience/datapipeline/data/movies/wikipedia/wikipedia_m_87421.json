It was shown in both conventional and IMAX Digital theaters.", "plot": "Five years after Kyra's death, Riddick has become increasingly uneasy in his role as Lord Marshal of the Necromonger fleet. His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects and assassination attempts by his subordinates. After the latest attempt on his life, Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako: the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako succeeding him as the next Lord Marshal, so that he can achieve what he calls transcendence. Led by Vaako's aide, Krone, Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Realizing that it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos, Krone causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive.\nRiddick emerges from the rubble with a broken leg, which he sets and splints while fending off native predators: vulture-like flying animals, packs of jackal-like beasts and swarms of venomous, scorpion-like water-dwelling creatures called Mud Demons. Needing time to heal, Riddick hides himself within some abandoned ruins. After he's fully healed, Riddick notices a vast savanna beyond some rocky cliffs, but the only passage through is impeded by several muddy pools infested with Mud Demons. He begins injecting himself with Mud Demon venom in order to build an immunity and constructs improvised melee weapons, as well as raising and training an orphaned jackal-beast pup. He kills the Mud Demons and reaches the savannah. After finding a dormant mercenary station, Riddick notices a series of approaching storms, and concludes they will unleash an unidentified threat. Riddick activates an emergency beacon at the station, which broadcasts his identity to mercenary groups within the area.\nTwo mercenary crews promptly arrive in answer to the beacon. The first, a barbaric group led by violent and unstable Santana, and consisting of second-in-command Diaz, preacher Luna and hunters Falco, Rubio, Vargas and Nunez. The second, a team of professional mercenaries; leader Colonel R. \"Boss\" Johns, second-in-command and marksman Dahl, tracker Lockspur and gunner Moss. Riddick leaves them a message promising they will all die unless they leave one of their ships and depart the planet on the other. Rubio, Nunez and Falco are killed by Riddick during the first night, forcing a reluctant Santana to cooperate with Johns' team. Riddick later steals power nodes from each of the teams' ships and approaches Johns and Santana to strike a deal for their return. However, the conversation turns into an ambush as Dahl shoots Riddick with several rounds of horse tranquilizer, and Riddick's jackal-beast is shot and killed by Santana.\nBack at the Station, Johns interrogates Riddick about the fate of his son, William J. Johns (the mercenary from Pitch Black). When the storms reach the station, Riddick's threat is revealed as thousands of Mud Demons emerge from hibernation underground, awakened by the rainwater, and besiege the station, killing Lockspur and Moss. Johns agrees to release Riddick in order to locate the hidden power cells, but Santana attempts to kill Riddick because he is worth twice as much dead as he is alive, and because Riddick promised to kill Santana within five seconds if set free. Riddick, with only one leg free, beheads Santana with his own machete, with Dahl remarking \"that was five seconds.\" The group then releases Riddick on the condition he retrieve the nodes and each party gets a ship.\nThey fight their way to the ships, however Vargas is killed by a mud demon. Johns, Diaz and Riddick leave the ship together on the hover-bikes to retrieve the power nodes. During their journey, Diaz knocks Johns' bike over the side of an embankment, causing him to crash. He is then picked up by Riddick. After they reach the power nodes, Riddick reveals Johns' son's morphine addiction, as well as his attempt to utilize a child as bait for the creatures. Diaz attempts to kill Riddick and Johns but Riddick fights and kills him, however as Diaz dies he shoots and disables the last hover bike, having already sabotaged the other.\nRiddick and Johns fend off a seemingly endless horde of Mud Demons while running back to the station. Riddick is severely wounded and Johns takes both nodes and abandons him. Riddick begins to fight a futile battle against the advancing Demons whilst climbing a rock spire. Just when it seems he is about to be killed, Johns arrives in a repowered  ship and shoots the creatures while Dahl descends to rescue Riddick. Giving him the other ship, Johns asks Riddick where he intends to go, before deciding he is better off not knowing. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son and departs into deep space.", "cast": "Vin Diesel as Riddick\nMatthew Nable as Colonel R. \"Boss\" Johns\nJordi Moll\u00e0 as Santana\nKatee Sackhoff as Dahl\nDave Bautista as Diaz\nBokeem Woodbine as Moss\nRaoul Trujillo as Lockspur\nConrad Pla as Vargas\nNolan Gerard Funk as Luna\nDanny Blanco Hall as Falco\nNoah Danby as Nu\u00f1ez\nNeil Napier as Rubio\nKarl Urban as Siberius Vaako\nAlex Branson as Lex Branman\nAndreas Apergis as Krone\nKeri Hilson as Santana's Prisoner"}
