It is usually a focal point for shops and retailers in the central business district, and is most often used in reference to retailing and socializing.\nThe term is commonly used in Ireland, Scotland, the United States, Canada, and less often in Australia and New Zealand.  In the non-Scottish regions of the United Kingdom, the common description is High Street though \"Fore Street\" or \"Front Street\" is commonplace in some parts. In Jamaica the term is Front Street.\nIn many places, the street name for such a street is actually \"Main Street\", though even where it isn't the term \"Main street\" is still used to describe the main thoroughfare of the central business district.  The \"Main Street of America\" branding was used to promote U.S. Route 66 in its heyday."}
