Although expected to make his own forecasts, he pays MIT graduate Delia Shepard (Lauren Lapkus) to do it for him. Steve lives with his childhood friend Ben Baker (Zach Galifianakis), a bearded hippie who spends his days smoking cannabis.\nOne day, Ben violently bursts into the WRSC premises to tell Steve his father has died of old age. Steve drives him to the funeral, but they arrive late due to Ben insisting they save some crayfish from ending up as bait. Despite missing all but the lowering of the casket, Ben is received with open arms by his stepmother Angela (Laura Ramsey), a young special education teacher who married Ben's father just 5 years prior. At the reading of the will later, Angela is left nothing; Ben's sister Terry (Amy Poehler) is left only 350,000 dollars; and Ben is left the family farm, store, and 2,000,000 dollars. Ben immediately goes out for fresh air and rips off his suit.\nBen decides to use his money to create a school that will spread New Age philosophy, and starts giving classes in the backyard of the family farm. However, he is soon stopped by Terry, who has decided to contest the will in court on account of Ben's sanity, for which Ben is required to attend a psychiatric evaluation. On the day of the appointment, Ben sneaks out through a window and approaches an Amish farm, hoping to use them as role models for his classes. The Amish family, terrified, fetches the police, which makes Steve drive back into town.\nThe psychiatrist concludes that, though bipolar, Ben is not a danger to himself or to others, so the court rules that Ben can dispose of his inheritance however he likes. Celebrating the ruling, Ben and Steve get drunk and Steve attempts to reveal to Angela that he has genuine feelings for her. Before leaving to return to work, Steve promises Ben he will bring him more cannabis, but Ben seems uninterested.\nBen has a depressive episode and starts believing there's no reason to live, and when Angela tries to console him, they end up having sex. The next morning, after taking his new medication, Ben shaves his beard off, meets with Terry and gives her full control of the store. Terry immediately has it torn down, purportedly to modernize it.\nWhen Steve issues a hurricane warning for an area that can't receive their signal, he realizes Ben is right, and the world needs more new age ideas. He goes to offer his support, but is livid when Terry tells him Ben slept with Angela.\nBen gives Steve control of the farm and goes off to live a normal life. Steve, however, is used to helping Ben with his problems, and relies on that crutch to give his life meaning, and realizes he too has problems. \nThe film ends when the rain Steve had been forecasting since the day of the funeral finally arrives, allowing Steve and Angela to forgive each other.", "cast": "Owen Wilson as Steve Dallas\nZach Galifianakis as Ben Baker\nAmy Poehler as Terry Coulter\nLaura Ramsey as Angela Baker\nAlana de la Garza as Victoria Riolobos\nLauren Lapkus as Delia Shepard\nPaul Schulze as Dave Harken\nGreg Cromer as Kyle Robertson\nEdward Herrmann as Dr. Vincent\nJenna Fischer as Alli\nDavid Selby as Karl Stevens\nPeter Bogdanovich as Judge Harlan Plath\nMelissa Rauch as Marie"}
