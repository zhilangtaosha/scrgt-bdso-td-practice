Although d'Artagnan is not able to join this elite corps immediately, he befriends the three most formidable musketeers of the age \u2013 Athos, Porthos and Aramis, \"the three inseparables,\" as these are called \u2013 and gets involved in affairs of the state and court.\nIn genre, The Three Musketeers is primarily a historical and adventure novel. However, Dumas also frequently works into the plot various injustices, abuses, and absurdities of the old regime, giving the novel an additional political aspect at a time when the debate in France between republicans and monarchists was still fierce. The story was first serialised from March to July 1844, during the July Monarchy, four years before the French Revolution of 1848 violently established the Second Republic.\nThe story of d'Artagnan is continued in Twenty Years After and The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later."}
