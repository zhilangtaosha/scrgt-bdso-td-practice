One who engages in sabotage is a saboteur. Saboteurs typically try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions.\nAny unexplained adverse condition might be sabotage. Sabotage is sometimes called tampering, meddling, tinkering, malicious pranks, malicious hacking, a practical joke, or the like to avoid needing to invoke legal and organizational requirements for addressing sabotage."}
