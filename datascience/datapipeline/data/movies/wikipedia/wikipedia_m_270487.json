His duties as the studio \"fixer\" find him corraling its scandalous stars, fending off twin gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker, and weighing an impressive job offer from the Lockheed Corporation. When unmarried synchronized swimming actress DeeAnna Moran becomes pregnant, Mannix arranges for her to place the baby in foster care then discreetly adopt it, preserving her image.\nBaird Whitlock, the dimwitted star of the studio's major production Hail, Caesar! A Tale of the Christ, is drugged and abducted. He awakens at a meeting of The Future, a group of Communist screenwriters, and is won over to their cause. The Future send a ransom note demanding $100,000 for Whitlock's return, which Mannix procures from the studio as \u201cpetty cash\u201d. He convinces Thora to withhold a story in exchange for information on singing Western film star Hobie Doyle.\nDoyle has been hopelessly cast in a comedy of manners and, despite the efforts of director Laurence Laurentz, cannot overcome his thick Southern American accent. When Laurentz requests Doyle's removal, Mannix convinces him to continue his coaching. Doyle admits to Mannix his trepidation about the role, but Mannix reassures him and confides in him about Whitlock's kidnapping.\nThat evening, Doyle attends the premiere of his new Western with starlet Carlotta Valdez, as arranged by Mannix. The pair are accosted by the Thacker sisters, but Doyle spots the briefcase of ransom money, carried by musical star Burt Gurney.\nMannix and Moran meet with surety agent Joseph Silverman, a trusted scapegoat for the studio, who agrees to foster Moran's child. His dependability proves immensely attractive to Moran.\nDoyle follows Gurney to The Future's beach house but finds only Whitlock inside. The Future have taken Gurney to rendezvous with a Soviet submarine and defect to Russia, but lose the briefcase in the ocean. Doyle returns Whitlock to the studio as the police arrive to arrest the group.\nMannix smacks Whitlock to stop his blathering in his newfound Communist jargon, but then orders him to \"go out and be a star\" and finish Hail, Caesar! The next morning, Mannix learns that Moran has married Silverman. Mannix rejects the Lockheed offer and decides to remain at Capitol Pictures. Thora informs him that her column will reveal Whitlock won his role by having sex with Laurentz. However, Mannix persuades her not to run the story as her source, Gurney \u2013 being a Communist defector \u2013 will tarnish her reputation. Mannix moves on, confident in his role in life."}
