Nothing seemed to have been taken from their run-down house so the police initially rule out robbery as a motive. They subsequently learn from Johannes's brother that the dead man was actually quite wealthy and when the bank confirms he withdrew a large sum every calendar quarter, they revise their ideas about a possible motive. Of equal concern to Wallander is a news report that Maria Johannes' last word to him before she died was that her attacker was a foreigner. Soon, the migrant farm workers in the area for the harvest are being targeted by vigilantes. Meanwhile, Wallander is having his own problems. He's in less than good health - he's a diabetic - and he's not sure he approves of his daughter's new boyfriend. As well, his father's dementia is worsening and he faces the prospect of having to institutionalize him.", "popularity": 1.114, "poster_path": "/y2HZUgJ6aiZ0f6dMKLqPPanq8pQ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 5340, "logo_path": "/tj8dH2Kcj1v3sh7Q617ImdcUvDh.png", "name": "Left Bank Pictures", "origin_country": "GB"}, {"id": 38227, "logo_path": null, "name": "TKBC", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 3324, "logo_path": "/16fY7pucCzn7WSOYxOGRHlAayL3.png", "name": "BBC", "origin_country": "GB"}, {"id": 5746, "logo_path": "/sWgSj9muRStENKBoIoaDK6OZmDu.png", "name": "Yellow Bird", "origin_country": "SE"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}], "release_date": "2010-01-03", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Wallander", "title": "Faceless Killers", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 6, "_movieID": "313963", "_source": "themovedb", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 10:09:42"}
