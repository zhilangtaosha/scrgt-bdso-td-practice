A humour empire like no other, the impact of the magazines irreverent, often shocking, sensibility was nothing short of seismic: this is an institution whose (drunk stoned brilliant) alumni left their fingerprints all over popular culture. Both insanely great and breathtakingly innovative, The National Lampoon created the foundation of modern comic sensibility by setting the bar in comedy impossibly high.", "popularity": 2.314, "poster_path": "/t7fqemeHtEaxG0Ry0bTox4spBY0.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 14007, "logo_path": "/y9b4a0PEtqJfdXmtWTVI15FPpQn.png", "name": "4th Row Films", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 1030, "logo_path": "/bus7KzJshT0VMXuKR7dwK5bqPSO.png", "name": "Magnolia Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 7469, "logo_path": null, "name": "History Films", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2015-01-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "If You Don't See This Documentary, We'll Shoot This Dog", "title": "Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead: The Story of the National Lampoon", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 31, "_movieID": "319070", "_source": "themovedb", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 09:10:41"}
