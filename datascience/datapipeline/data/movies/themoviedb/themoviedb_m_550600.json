Since then, it has grown into an organization that treats more than a million patients a year from all 50 states and 150 countries. Dr. Mayo had a simple philosophy he imparted to his sons Will and Charlie: \"the needs of the patient come first.\" They wouldn't treat diseases...they would treat people. In a world where healthcare delivery is typically fragmented among individual specialties, the Mayo Clinic practices a multi-specialty, team-based approach that has, from its beginnings, created a culture that thrives on collaboration.", "popularity": 1.322, "poster_path": "/zojyFTrXTdULii1Jh5yHmG0ZTHq.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 10725, "logo_path": "/swRdpENnqrmcommkdcTp7Lv2Afa.png", "name": "WETA", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2018-09-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Mayo Clinic, Faith, Hope and Science", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 2, "_movieID": "550600", "_source": "themovedb", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 02:55:44"}
