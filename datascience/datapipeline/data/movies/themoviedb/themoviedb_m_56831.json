Set in a New York tenement apartment, the story focuses on two very different men - a deeply religious black ex-con who thwarts the suicide attempt of an asocial white college professor who tried to throw himself in front of an oncoming subway train, 'The Sunset Limited.' As the one attempts to connect on a rational, spiritual and emotional level, the other remains steadfast in his hard-earned despair. Locked in a philosophical debate, both passionately defend their personal credos and try to convert the other.", "popularity": 4.802, "poster_path": "/vv5aU4ed63nWPCrXfnxd40Gx7fQ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 7429, "logo_path": "/6in9uMqxXEHx5XgYgkeRBpZ4rPw.png", "name": "HBO Films", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 2322, "logo_path": null, "name": "The Javelina Film Company", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2011-02-12", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Nothing is ever black or white.", "title": "The Sunset Limited", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 204, "_movieID": "56831", "_source": "themovedb", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 10:35:40"}
