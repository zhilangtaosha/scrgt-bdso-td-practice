Exploring the decades-long campaign by the Nobel Prize winner, filmmaker Maurice Fitzpatrick reveals how Hume - inspired by Martin Luther King - became the moral architect for peace in Northern Ireland.\r In the Name of Peace: John Hume in America is a compelling feature documentary, narrated by Liam Neeson, with dramatic footage and stirring interviews with Presidents Clinton and Carter, US senators and congressmen, and Irish and British leaders.  With a musical score by Bill Whelan (Riverdance), this beautiful film reminds us of the redemptive powers of politics to overcome division. It is a timely story that profiles creative leadership, international cooperation and the U.S. contribution to peace and stability on the island of Ireland.", "popularity": 0.878, "poster_path": "/zeO6DvTy22GGdX68MKZzZ3mSoY.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IE", "name": "Ireland"}], "release_date": "2017-09-24", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "In the Name of Peace: John Hume in America", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "_movieID": "526005", "_source": "themovedb", "created_utc_dt": "08/28/2019, 09:44:50"}
