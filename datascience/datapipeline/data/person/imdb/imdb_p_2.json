You can't have it one way and not the other. It's art-you can't not censor one thing and try to censor the other. Saying Tarantino said \"nigger\" too many times is like complaining they said \"kike\" too many times in a movie about Nazis.", "[2013, on white directors doing films based on black history] There is this whole thing of \"Nobody can tell our story but us,\" but that's apparently not true, because the Jackie Robinson movie finally got made as 42. Spike (Lee) didn't make it, but people still went to see it. When 'Boaz Yakin' (qv) did _Fresh (1994)_ (qv) in 1994, all of a sudden it was like, \"Who is this Jewish motherfucker telling our stories?\" He's the Jewish motherfucker who wrote the story, that's who. If you got a story like that in you, tell it. We'll see when [director] 'Steve McQueen' (qv)'s movie _12 Years a Slave (2013)_ (qv) comes out, if it'll be like, \"What's this British motherfucker know about us?\" Somebody's always going to say something.", "(2013) I'm not trying to change the world. I'm just trying to entertain people.", "(2013, on directing) I don't have that directing thing. I don't want to be out there setting up shots all day. I like to act. I read the script and sign the contract. I like hanging out in my trailer watching _Judge Judy (1996)_ (qv) and eating sandwiches.", "(2013, on maintaining sobriety) What's it been now, 22 years or something? There's all kinds of shit in my house that I've never tasted in my life, like Cristal-stuff I couldn't afford back when I was drinking. All I'd have to do is walk in the closet, open a beer, and no one would know, but I know that I probably wouldn't stop at one beer. So I drink nonalcoholic beer. I'm not looking for the kick.", "(2013, on _Jungle Fever (1991)_ (qv) and staying sober) I got out of rehab, and about a week or something later, I was shooting the movie. I had a modicum of fame because I'd done other 'Spike Lee' (qv) movies, so when I'd go buy coke or something, the guys sitting around would go, \"Hey, man, __Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv)_(Qv)! Yeah, sit down!\" and I sat right down and got high with them. All of a sudden with _Jungle Fever (1991)_ (qv) I'm travelling in a different circle, which brought the next challenge because that circle has some darkness too-drink, drugs, only now they're offering them to you free. Now you have the chance to really get fucked-up. You know how it is. Make a wrong turn at a party and there's a bunch of people sitting around a table with more cocaine in front of them than you saw the entire time when you were using. I said to myself, Do you want to be fucked-up and think you're having a good time, or do you want to be satisfied artistically and spiritually in another way? I chose the other way.", "(2013, on quitting drugs & alcohol and re-establishing his career) In 1990 my wife said, \"Look, you're going to rehab,\" and the very next day I was in rehab. I didn't go kicking and screaming. I was tired, burned-out and at that low point of like, What the fuck is going on with me? They ask you in rehab to take an assessment of how you got to the point you're at, and I said, \"I guess I could have gone to that audition without my eyes red, without smelling like the beer I had or the weed I'd smoked.\" I never blamed anybody else for not being successful or not getting to the places I saw everybody else I worked with, like Wesley Snipes, get to. I had no problem doing roles like Black Guy in _Sea of Love (1989)_ (qv) or Hold-Up Man in _Coming to America (1988)_ (qv) or going to Boston once a year to get killed on _Spenser: For Hire (1985)_ (qv) or _A Man Called Hawk (1989)_ (qv). LaTanya asked, \"Why are you doing these piddly-ass jobs?\" I told her, \"Well, this or that guy I worked with is probably going to be something somewhere down the line.\" I always left an impression in an audition. I was memorable. In rehab I saw that I owed it to myself to see things another way and try it the other way. I opened my mind to what was being said... Like the petals were closed and, all of a sudden, the sun hit the flower and opened it up. People looked at it and it smelled great, it looked great to them. I'm like, Oh Jesus, this is not bad at all. I wondered whether I was going to be as much fun as I used to be, wondered whether people were going to think I was as good an actor. But the clarity and professional satisfaction that came with sobriety-couldn't beat it.", "[on _Snakes on a Plane (2006)_ (qv)) I stand by that movie!", "I did t.v., I did film, I did theater, I did children's theater.
