He is of Russian Jewish descent. At 17, he took his first step towards becoming a stand-up comedian when he spontaneously took the stage at a Boston comedy club. He found he was a natural comic. He nurtured his talent while at New York University (graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991) by performing regularly in clubs and at universities. During his freshman year, he snagged a recurring role as the Huxtable family's friend Smitty on _The Cosby Show (1984)_ (qv). While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was \"discovered\" by 'Dennis Miller' (qv), who recommended him to _Saturday Night Live (1975)_ (qv) producer 'Lorne Michaels' (qv) and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing.
