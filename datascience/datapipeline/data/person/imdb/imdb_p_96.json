All of a sudden it's ten years later, your career's happened, and you haven't had any control. I still assume that, any day, I'm going to be exposed as a fraud. That, like I once heard 'Gene Hackman' (qv) say, the acting police are going to burst in and take away my card.", "My mom was an actress for many years, and my father has been an actor since he came out here [Hollywood] from New York in 1964 and was under contract at Universal for many years. My grandmother was a B-movie actress at Universal, and my sister was an actress for a while, but then she did a bunch of other stuff... so I've been around it all my life. Growing up in a family of actors, what's great about it is that they're very supportive and they understand what it's like to be an actor - the rejections, the highs and lows... and having a common language with them is great because you have shorthand speech.", "[2006] I believe in luck and fate and I believe in karma, that the energy you put out in the world comes back to meet you. So if you have positive good energy, hopefully good things will come to you from the universe... I definitely have a spiritual outlook. I don't usually read self-help books, but I read a great book by a guy called Wayne Dyer, \"The Power of Intention\", which I loved. I am not a religious guy, I am probably agnostic but I thought what this writer had to say was really powerful. The more you are positive and say I want to have a good life, the more you build that reality for yourself; by creating the life that you want. It is not always the case that things will fall into your lap or that life will be great, but it is all about perspective and having a positive outlook. If something goes wrong, you say, \"That happened for a reason, what can I learn from that and how can I grow?\".", "[2006] I took part in a theater festival in Massachusetts two summers after I graduated from college. Then I was in Los Angeles thinking I am going to go to New York. I had decided that I would not have a chance of a film career, so I was about to make the move. I bought a plane ticket and found a place to live in New York, packed my bags and of course the universe told me that I was not meant to go. Suddenly a week before I was supposed to leave, I had three job offers and one of them was my first movie. I think that when you let go and throw it all away and stop getting attached and say whatever happens, happens, you don't invest too much in anything particular, and things work out. As an actor, it is easy to be so self-critical, saying to yourself, Am I good enough? Am I good looking enough? Am I smart enough? Yet here I am, so I am lucky.", "[2006, on working with 'Lindsay Lohan' (qv)] When I got the job I thought about her a lot. Not only was I getting a great job in a really good movie, but it was with 'Lindsay Lohan' (qv). She is so famous and I don't have any of that. I have never experienced that kind of intense scrutiny that she is under, so of course I wondered what it would be like acting opposite her. I can tell you that it is like being with the Beatles. You cannot fathom the kind of attention she gets. It is mind boggling. We were filming in New Orleans and decided to go to Tulane to a party. But you cannot just \"show up\" to a party with Lindsay, it becomes an event unto itself. You hear the whispers, then the whispers become gaggles of people, then the gaggles of people becomes masses of people and the masses of people bring the paparazzi and then everything becomes exaggerated. If she was drinking water, people would say \"Why is she drinking water?\". So it was a learning experience for me to be around and to see what that was like and to separate fact from fiction. When I was 18 I was an emotional wreck and I couldn't imagine having to deal with that kind of fame, so I would say she dealt with it well and has a lot of grace. I think: good for her. She has met with such a lot of criticism and so I'm glad she is outspoken and opinionated and says what she thinks.", "[on his biggest quirks] I talk to myself, especially in the car. I do it to work through ideas, or if I'm pissed off. I use the interior of the car like it's a [therapist's office].", "[on pre-acting jobs] I worked in a restaurant and in a bakery, and I once worked for my landlord as a construction guy who would repair things in the house. But I was not very good because I do not know a hammer from a screwdriver, so that did not last long.", "[2006] I performed and sang at school but as a child it was never anything I was interested in doing professionally. But it all struck home when I was at college, Berkeley in San Francisco. I was still very shy and I decided to go to the theater to audition and I started doing plays and loved it. So it's all gone on from there. I studied English and actually went to England for a year, to Leeds in the north of the country to study. It was a year abroad and that was wonderful. I had the time of my life. Everybody always talks about a dying passion for acting, but it never really happened for me that way, it happened so organically. Right now I cannot see myself doing anything else because it is so fascinating and a lot of it is really about human psychology. But I do have other interests like writing and playing music.", "[on watching his own films] I am critical of myself like everyone else. You go to a movie theater and you are forty feet high. I had bad skin as a teenager and I am a shy person, but I think I am in the perfect business to fight my insecurities. You have to learn to love yourself and say \"I am pretty cool\" instead of being so critical. You can easily fall into the trap of doing that.", "[on kissing 'Lindsay Lohan' (qv) during the masquerade ball scene in _Just My Luck (2006)_ (qv)] Well at the time I was really sick with a fever. In fact, my sister came to stay, to take care of me. So I wasn't feeling well, and we were shooting amongst a huge crowd of extras. It is supposed to be an intimate scene, we are dancing, but of course it was not like that at all. There was no music and I was being yelled at, \"To the left! I need to see the left side of your face.\" It could not be more artificial, but she was great and we laughed about it. It did feel awkward but we got into the rhythm of it. She was a great kisser, she has great big lips and she is gorgeous.", "There have been, like, three auditions in my life where I feel like I'm in a _Saturday Night Live (1975)_ (qv) skit. One was for _Avatar (2009)_ (qv), which was probably the worst audition I ever gave. Another was for _10,000 BC (2008)_ (qv), where I was just, like, on my haunches pretending to be in a loincloth in Burbank. Then the other one was _Star Trek (2009)_ (qv). It was all this jargon talk of torpedoes and photons.", "[on portraying Captain James T. Kirk in _Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)_ (qv)] At this point, he isn't really the captain of the Enterprise. So the journey of this film is to see the non-captain in a position of nominal power, but psychologically and emotionally going through some sort of age existential crisis, where he's riddled with self-doubt and confusion and fears that he may not be the best man for the job. That was really exciting and kind of took the majority of my thought and time space.", "[on filming _Just My Luck (2006)_ (qv) with 'Lindsay Lohan' (qv)] It was a real cyclone of insanity, like being around The Beatles. It was fascinating to watch, and in hindsight it's really a distinct moment in someone's life when you see what's really wonderful about what we get to do and what's really dangerous about it.", "Hollywood is like living in a weird bubble.
