Before successfully auditioning for the Harry Potter films, Rupert attended Richard Hale Secondary School in Hertford: here he took an active interest in school plays, being cast as Rumplestilskin in the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. He was also a regular attendee at weekend drama classes at Top Hat Stage School, also in Hertford.Time at school was limited, as Rupert was needed on set for the Harry Potter films, where all of the child actors were tutored for four hours a day on set, to keep up with legal requirements. During the summer of 2004, he took his GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) exams and completed his formal education.::BarbieWelsh"], "trade mark": ["Red hair", "Catchphrase: \"Bloody hell!\""], "trivia": ["Has one brother and three sisters.", "On his audition tape for Harry Potter, he performed hip-hop lyrics that he wrote to promote himself for the role of Ron Weasley.", "Loving the Harry Potter series, 'Rupert Grint' (qv) found out that there were auditions for the feature film, so he got the part although he had previously only acted in one school play.", "Siblings are: James (b. 1990); Georgina (b. 1993); Samantha (b. 1996); and Charlotte (b. 1998).", "Says he would like to be invisible so he could sneak out of detention at school", "Has arachnophobia and, as of 2010, has still not watched the whole, completed Aragog scene from _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)_ (qv).", "Plays the guitar a little bit and also plays the didgeridoo.", "He attended an all boys-school in his hometown.", "He likes all kinds of music, but his favorite is classic rock and roll.", "His favorite actor is 'Jim Carrey' (qv).
