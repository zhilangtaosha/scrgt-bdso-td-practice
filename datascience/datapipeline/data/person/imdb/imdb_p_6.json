Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a Priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in _Endless Love (1981)_ (qv) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.With handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years 'Tom Cruise' (qv) was starring in some of the top grossing films of the 1980s including _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv); _The Color of Money (1986)_ (qv), _Rain Man (1988)_ (qv) and _Born on the Fourth of July (1989)_ (qv). By the 1990s he was one of the highest paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as _Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)_ (qv), _Mission: Impossible (1996)_ (qv) and _Jerry Maguire (1996)_ (qv) for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. 'Tom Cruise' (qv)'s biggest franchise , Mission Impossible has also earned a total of 3 billion dollars worldwide. Tom cruise has also shown lots of interest in producing with his biggest producer credits being the Mission impossible franchise.In 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church Of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, 'Tom Cruise' (qv) is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress 'Nicole Kidman' (qv) until 2001.

So, the first time I met 'Rob Reiner' (qv) - I'd been told, \"You know, Tom, he's a pretty aggressive guy.\" He's a big guy. Big hands. Very bright, articulate. When he talks his points, he gets very loud because he gets very excited. He's just so fucking smart. He's very intense, but he's also like a teddy bear you want to hug. We read the script together - I'd already planned on doing it, but we were working on things like structure - and he would read it imagining the nine different characters. And he started imitating 'Jack Nicholson' (qv). That's how he found out that 'Jack Nicholson' (qv) should play the role. The character I play, Kaffee, is a very tough, complex role to play. You're either going to hit or miss with this guy. All of the scenes, all the rhythms, come from character and even though Rob worked so hard on it himself, he trusts the actors to breathe life into their roles. You'll look over at him on the set and he's saying the lines along with the actors. You become really bonded with this guy because there's nothing more he wants for you than to be great. And you feel that.", "[on his character Jack Reacher in _Jack Reacher (2012)_ (qv)] Reacher is such a great character. He doesn't have a cell phone, he doesn't have email. He's off the grid. He pays for things in cash. People look at things through the prism of the colours of their life, but Jack Reacher does things the way we want to sometimes.

How do you define winning and losing? If I get beaten in a basketball game, I don't care. How a movie does is based on so many things, including release dates and marketing. I understand the box office game. I was there in the beginning when they started fixating on the number one film and the competition in that. I really came up with promoting films around the world, and studios fought me, but I mainly did it because I wanted myself and my kids to see the world. But here's the game I'm playing. I want to make great films that entertain an audience and hold up. I can control only the effort I put into it and the experience we all have making it. After that, it is what it is.", "(2012) Whether it's making a film or raising my children, personally I'm striving to do the right things and to learn. I'm an all-or-nothing kind of person, and when I become interested in something, I give it my all. In life, I always wanted adventures and to learn different fields of endeavor. The great thing about being an actor is I've gotten to see what a fighter pilot's life is like and a race car driver's. I've gotten to fly airplanes, race cars, learn about motorcycles. In _Rock of Ages (2012)_ (qv), I studied music, learned how to sing and see it from a singer's vantage point. I carry those interests and lessons through my own life. I guess I am always striving to be competent.", "(2012, on his favorite 'toy') Each one has its different level of freedom. A fast motorcycle is wonderful, but I'd have to say it would be the P-51 Warbird. I have a 1944 Tuskegee Airmen P-51 that was part of their training squadron. When I traveled around as a kid, I had a picture of a Spitfire and a picture of a P-51. P means \"pursuit\", and you can fly hard through the canyons. It's a beautiful airplane, unlike anything else.", "(2012, on learning to fly) I always wanted to fly, and that was one of the reasons I did _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv). I just never had the time to learn. Then I met 'Sydney Pollack' (qv). I was 19 or 20. He was editing _Tootsie (1982)_ (qv), and I'd just finished _Risky Business (1983)_ (qv). I got a meeting with Sydney that was supposed to be 20 minutes and ended up being over two hours. Outside of my admiration for him as a filmmaker, we talked about a big mutual interest that we had in aviation because I knew he flew. Sydney became a lifelong friend, and when we finished _The Firm (1993)_ (qv) together in 1993 or 1994, he gave me flying lessons as a gift. He said, \"I know how much you love flying. Take the time, right now, and do it, because otherwise you'll never get to it.\" I had two kids by then, and I worked all the time. In a few months, I had my instrument rating and, a little while after that, I had my commercial rating. I trained mostly in aerobatics, because I wanted to fly the P-51. I was doing rolls, loops, all kinds of aerobatic maneuvers. My first airplane was called a Pitts, and then I flew a Marchetti. That's a third-world air force trainer they use in the Navy's TOPGUN schools for air-to-air combat. This was all in preparation to fly the Warbird, the P-51. I searched all over the world for my P-51 and found it in 2000. It's called \"Kiss Me Kate\", which covers two things I love most, my wife and movies.", "[on 'Tony Scott' (qv)] He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable.", "[on preparing for _Rock of Ages (2012)_ (qv)] I spent months studying the history of rock 'n' roll for my role as Stacee Jaxx and 'Queen' (qv) and 'Freddie Mercury' (qv) were a big part of that.", "[on this intense passion for his work] I love what I do. I take great pride in what I do. And I can't do something halfway, three-quarters, nine-tenths. If I'm going to do something, I go all the way.", "[on what he likes about London, England] I love the fish and chips, the crews are fantastic, it's such a beautiful city, and the people are so easy and cool. I like a good curry, I like it hot, and you have great Indian food here also. I like it very spicy. If I'm not sweating I don't feel like I have had good Indian food.", "[on Ireland and his part Irish ancestry] I'm very proud to be Irish. There's a pride in America of being Irish. I can't wait to come back and I want to visit the land of my ancestors and the castle that they had.", "[on _Edge of Tomorrow (2014)_ (qv)] The alien invasion is simmering in the background.
