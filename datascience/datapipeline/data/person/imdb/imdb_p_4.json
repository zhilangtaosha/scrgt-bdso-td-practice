His mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.'Ron Howard' (qv) was working on _Splash (1984)_ (qv), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to 'John Candy' (qv). Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy _Dragnet (1987)_ (qv), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy _Big (1988)_ (qv) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in _A League of Their Own (1992)_ (qv). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with _Sleepless in Seattle (1993)_ (qv) and then with _Philadelphia (1993)_ (qv). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster _Forrest Gump (1994)_ (qv) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.Hanks' next role - astronaut and commander 'Jim Lovell' (qv), in the docudrama _Apollo 13 (1995)_ (qv) - reunited him with 'Ron Howard' (qv). Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, 'Gary Sinise' (qv), 'Ed Harris' (qv), and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film _Toy Story (1995)_ (qv), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy _That Thing You Do! (1996)_ (qv) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.::Pedro Borges"], "spouse": ["'Rita Wilson' (qv)::(30 April 1988 - present) ( 2 children)", "'Samantha Lewes' (qv)::(24 January 1978 - 19 March 1987) ( divorced) ( 2 children)"], "trade mark": ["Frequently plays ordinary characters in extraordinary situations", "Likable, mild-mannered and good-natured personality", "Frequently works with 'Robert Zemeckis' (qv), 'Steven Spielberg' (qv), and 'Ron Howard' (qv)"], "trivia": ["Is a frequent guest host on _Saturday Night Live (1975)_ (qv).", "Received the Distinguished Public Service Award, the United States Navy's highest civilian honor, on Veterans Day 1999 for his work in the epic _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv).", "Entertainment Weekly chose him as the only actor worthy of $20 million.", "Dislocated his shoulder when he fell through a rotting floor in a building in Germany while scouting locations with 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) for the HBO series _Band of Brothers (2001)_ (qv) (1999).", "Second actor to win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars, for his work in _Philadelphia (1993)_ (qv) and _Forrest Gump (1994)_ (qv).

It was just nine months after they pulled out of Afghanistan that the Berlin wall came down.

He is the most uncompromising filmmaker - both in a good way and a bad way - that you'll ever come across. This is the guy who made _Scarface (1983)_ (qv). So his take on it one just one of those things.

You think, Oh, I know how to do this. But you can't even begin to know anything after two movies, though you can get arrogant and lazy. I didn't become an actor to develop a personality cult or to get power over people. I went into this because it's fun, because it's a great way to make a living. That really governs my reaction to it all. But you get all this attention. Your head can play all sorts of bizarre tricks. By now, I think I have a pretty good grasp of how this stuff works. I fought my battles a long time ago. I guess you have a period when you think you deserve all the attention you're getting. You have people surrounding you, telling you that you're the greatest thing in the world. I honestly don't think I have an inflated view of myself now. But it happens.", "[on _The Man with One Red Shoe (1985)_ (qv)] Not a very good movie. It doesn't have any real, clear focus to it.

It made no money at all.", "[on _Nothing in Common (1986)_ (qv)] Has a bit of a split personality, because we're trying to be very funny in the same movie in which we're trying to be very touching.

It's convoluted. There are problems with it. It should be funnier.", "[on _Punchline (1988)_ (qv)] That's the hardest one to make any sort of judgment on. The movie didn't do that well, which was really disappointing. If I were going to figure out why, I would end up taking a bunch of cheap shots at an awful lot of people who tried real hard, and that's not fair. What can you say? But it's the best work I've ever done. We were talking some real naked truths about the characters and, in a lot of ways, about myself. I was too close. The guy in Punchline probably has the worst aspects of my worst aspects. He is extremely competitive, for one thing. Competitive to a fault. He is unable to balance his daily existence so that real life and what he does for a living have an equal weight. I've certainly had those problems; I think any actor has: The only time you really feel alive is when you're working. I've gotten a little more mature since I was like that, but I think that's what really drives actors absolutely stark-raving mad and why they develop ulcers and drug problems. Part of it is the insecurity factor-every time, you feel like you're never going to get another chance again. They're going to catch on, and that'll be it. Even when you're working a lot, you think, \"How many of these do I get?\", It's like they give you only so many dollars in your wallet and once those dollars are spent, you're broke.", "[on working with 'Jackie Gleason' (qv) in _Nothing in Common (1986)_ (qv)] I was intimidated up to a point, but we worked as peers. I was certainly deferential and respectful. He wasn't feeling a hundred percent as far as his health, so he was kind of slow. But it was amazing: He came in exactly at nine, worked straight through to five. He had it down, knew what he wanted to do, got up and did it. He was just very, very professional.", "As a child, I had an incredible amount of freedom to do whatever I wanted to do. By the time I was in junior high school, I was wandering around, freely, as much as I wanted to. A free spirit.", "[on why his parents divorced] Mostly because of money. They weren't well off, and neither one of them could deal with four kids at one time. Also, my dad wanted us. Since then, I've had a divorce myself and I went back and talked to my parents. I asked them how they could do that, split us up. The answer was that you do what you have to do at the time. After that, my dad met another woman and married her and we moved to Reno. She had five kids of her own. Suddenly, it was, like-bang, zoom!-there were eight kids around. We were total strangers, all thrust together. I remember in school we had to draw a picture of our house and family and I ran out of places to put people. I put them on the roof. I drew Dad in bed, sleeping, since he worked so hard in the restaurant. When he and she split up, I never saw those people again.", "[on his on-screen heroes] 'Robert Duvall' (qv). All he has to do is walk across the street. And certainly 'Jack Nicholson' (qv). And 'Robert De Niro' (qv). I would see whatever 'Jason Robards' (qv) did. 'Steve McQueen' (qv); he was really cool. Also, film directors. 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv) was a huge thing for me; _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_ (qv) was probably the most influential film, movie, story, artistic package, whatever, that I ever saw. It was just bigger. It affected me much, much more than anything I had ever seen. There was just awe. I've seen that movie twenty-two times. In theaters, not on video tape. Every time I saw it, I saw something new, something else that Kubrick had put in. He was able to suspend my disbelief. I just felt, We are in space. The only other things that affected me as profoundly were reading Catcher in the Rye and finding out, in the fifth or sixth grade, about the Holocaust. I remember feeling as alone as Holden Caulfield did, thinking, This isn't talking about me, or my life, yet I know how he feels. Another thing about that book: I remember being very impressed at seeing the word crap in print.", "[on experimenting with drugs] As to drugs, there isn't anybody who didn't smoke pot. And I also had done some blow. But I never did LSD. I never even did Qu\u00e3aludes or anything like that, though all of this stuff, especially for someone who worked in the theater, was abundant. Smoking pot just made me the stupidest human being in the world.", "I think my world image would have been very different if I had lost my virginity in high school, but I didn't. No _Bachelor Party (1984)_ (qv) antics, I'm afraid. I just had a girlfriend for a long time. But something important did happen in high school. I took a drama class that determined my career. In the course of ten weeks, I saw five completely different types of theater. I felt that the theater was as magical a place as existed, and I wanted to be involved in it. So I majored in theater arts. After I saw a Berkeley Repertory Theater production of The Iceman Cometh, I knew I'd do anything to be a part of it. I went to Chabot College, where they had a great theater department. I started out operating the lights and building the sets. Later on, I began to perform and went off to the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Cleveland as slave labor. That was my big break. I went back to Sacramento as a professional actor and then went to New York with my wife and child. It was a war of survival, really. I was a kid who had never been in such a big city before. I was on unemployment and trying to act. My wife was an actress as well, and she was pursuing that as best she could. This went on for two years. Finally, I got a job in a low-budget movie, and after that, I got a development deal with ABC and we moved to California.", "[on landing _Bosom Buddies (1980)_ (qv)] I had lived in New York for a couple of years and had developed, I guess, a defense mechanism when it came to auditions. And that was not to care about them too much. So I was able to go in and be so casual, so nonchalant about impressing those people that I'd screw it up-as opposed to trying to show them how great and unique a talent you are. People hate you when you do that. Eventually, a development deal was struck, which meant I would probably work in some ABC-TV series. It worked out to be \"Bosom Buddies\". We all had a great time. I thought we did some really excellent television shows. We, as actors, got to be a very, very finely-honed team. It was a great marriage, as far as that goes...By the end of two seasons, we were pretty well flagged. We were just exhausted. Everybody probably would have said the show was canceled at the right time, because we would have begun to chew each other's heads off.", "[on working with 'Penny Marshall' (qv) on _Big (1988)_ (qv)] Well, one thing she did that drove me crazy was to test over and over and over again with all sorts of actors. There were scenes that I must have done two hundred times on video tape and then two hundred more in the rehearsal process. Penny just wanted to see all sorts of things. I would say, \"I can't do this scene one more time. I don't care who it is. I cannot read these same goddamn words one more time or by the time we get to making the movie, I'm going to hate it so much that I'm not going to do it at all\". Well, what happened instead was, I knew the material so well that by the time we shot it, it turned out to be the best rehearsed of all the movies that I've done. There are only certain people I would accept that from. Penny is one. To most others, I would say, \"Look, you either tell me exactly what is wrong or what is right about this or I'm going to strangle you\".", "[on filming the keyboard dancing sequence in _Big (1988)_ (qv)] It was exhausting. We rehearsed until we dropped. 'Robert Loggia' (qv) plays three sets of tennis every day, so he was in shape for it. It was like jumping rope for three and a half hours every time we did the scene. It was really hard work.", "[on peers he admires] 'Sean Penn' (qv) brings an integrity to his work that I think we all wish we had. 'Mickey Rourke' (qv) is a guy I'll pay five dollars to walk across the street and see. There's something he does that he loads up his movies with, whether they're good or bad. Also 'Kevin Costner' (qv), 'Tom Berenger' (qv) and 'Michael Keaton' (qv). I rarely go to the movies when I don't think, \"Man, I wish I had that part\", you know?", "[on if he's gotten use to being rich and famous] It's a kick in the head, but it doesn't add to my ability. It doesn't add to my self-worth. I've always felt I could buy whatever I wanted, to tell you the truth, even when I didn't have any money. I honestly don't need an awful lot to keep me happy. What the money can do is guarantee the security of an awful lot of other people. I've been able to help my family. It's great to be able to do nice things for the people I care about. (As far as being famous), I remember that I'm not a rocket scientist. The only thing I have to protect from too much attention is my family, which I can do, for the most part. I talk to the press all the time. I'm accessible. It makes things easier. People leave you alone more. It is still a bit disconcerting to see a picture of myself and my wife in a tabloid or something like that, but big deal. I don't really go out into real public situations. I don't know what's going to happen if I try to go to hockey games next year and I can't get out of the place.

She gave you books to read and took you to cafes you'd never heard of that became legends. You discovered Krispy Kremes from boxes she held out, and you learned there is such a thing as a perfect tuna sandwich. She would give your kids small, goofy parts in movies with the caveat that they might not make the final cut but you'd get a tape of the scene. For a wrap gift she would send you a note saying something like, \"A man is going to come to your house to plant an orange tree - or apple or pomegranate or whatever - and you will eat its fruit for the rest of your days.\"", "I am a lay historian by nature. I seek out an empirical reflection of what truth is. I sort of want dates and motivations and I want the whole story.
