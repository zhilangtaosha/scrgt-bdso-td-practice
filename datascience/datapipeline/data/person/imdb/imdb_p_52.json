However, his portrayals of Billy Beane in _Moneyball (2011)_ (qv), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography.Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for \"el Pollo Loco\".Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera _Another World (1964)_ (qv) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera _Dallas (1978)_ (qv). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in _Thelma & Louise (1991)_ (qv), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned 'Geena Davis' (qv). This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as _Johnny Suede (1991)_ (qv) and _Cool World (1992)_ (qv).But Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in _A River Runs Through It (1992)_ (qv), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in _True Romance (1993)_ (qv) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as _Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)_ (qv) and _Legends of the Fall (1994)_ (qv), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller _Se7en (1995)_ (qv). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in _Twelve Monkeys (1995)_ (qv) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.Pitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama _Troy (2004)_ (qv) helped establish his appeal as action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick _Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)_ (qv). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married 'Jennifer Aniston' (qv) in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met his current partner 'Angelina Jolie' (qv). Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as _Megamind (2010)_ (qv) to adventurous critic-bait like _Inglourious Basterds (2009)_ (qv) and _The Tree of Life (2011)_ (qv). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for _The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)_ (qv) and _Moneyball (2011)_ (qv). In 2014, he starred in the war film _Fury (2014)_ (qv), opposite 'Shia LaBeouf' (qv), 'Logan Lerman' (qv), 'Jon Bernthal' (qv), and 'Michael Pe\u00f1a' (qv).Pitt and Jolie have six children, including two sons and a daughter who were adopted.::Anonymous and JJH"], "spouse": ["'Angelina Jolie' (qv)::(14 August 2014 - present) ( filed for divorce) ( 6 children)", "'Jennifer Aniston' (qv)::(29 July 2000 - 2 October 2005) ( divorced)"], "trade mark": ["Chiseled good looks", "Strong jawline and bold blue eyes", "Frequently works with 'David Fincher' (qv)"], "trivia": ["Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#23) (1995).", "Turned down a role as an astronaut in _Apollo 13 (1995)_ (qv) to accept his role in _Se7en (1995)_ (qv).", "Posed for a campus calendar in college.", "A girl went to Pitt's Hollywood-area home shortly after midnight January 7, 1999 and crawled in through an open window, dressed herself in his clothes and stayed for 10 hours before the alarm went off.

It gives me goosebumps to talk about it.", "[on being dumped by ex-fianc\u00e9e 'Jill Schoelen' (qv) in 1989] She called me up in Los Angeles and was crying on the phone. She was lonely and there was a huge drama. At this point, I had $800 to my name and I spent $600 of it getting a ticket from Los Angeles to Hungary to see her. I got there, went straight to the set where she was filming and that night we went out to dinner. She told me that she had fallen in love with the director of the film. I was so shocked I said, \"I'm outta here.\" I spent my night in Budapest, sitting on a bench, smoking, with just a local bum to talk to who couldn't speak English. These are the days and nights you remember when you have success. I returned to America absolutely broke. This is why recognition does not bother me too much.", "Fame makes you feel permanently like a girl walking past construction workers.", "[2009] What's valuable to me has become clearer as I've got older. To me, it's about the value of your time and your day and the value of the people you spend it with. It's about me being a strong father and guide and a good match for my significant other. Then, if I'm going to go to work, it must be something of value to me. I'm much more experienced now, so I can find films that are interesting quicker and cut out the films that don't really matter. It means more to me now because my kids are going to see them, and I want them to be proud.", "[1998, on why he moved to Los Angeles] A lot of the attraction before I came out was the fame, the lifestyle... now my motivation is more, \"I want to be good!\".", "We make breakfast like everyone else and it's chaos and pancake batter splashed all over the place and bath time at night. Ultimately, I'm dad. I have the concerns a dad has. Is everyone safe? Am I spending enough time with them? These are the things that keep me awake.", "[on comparing his own parenting style with that of his character in _The Tree of Life (2011)_ (qv)]: They say actions speak louder than words. It's even more true with my kids. And so it's quite important to me not to put my frustrations on them or bring them in the door. I want to keep them to be free and not encumbered with my junk. In the film it's the exact opposite. I find it very sad, a very sad man who was embittered by his situation, doesn't feel he can get ahead, always feels like he's on the losing end, feels quite oppressed by his surroundings and predicament, doesn't know why it isn't working out for him and why is it working out for other people. That poisoned view of things.", "There are no secrets in our house. We tell the kids, \"Mom and Dad are going off to kiss.\".", "[2011] I spent the '90s trying to hide out, trying to duck the full celebrity cacophony. I started to get sick of myself sitting on a couch, holding a joint, hiding out. It started feeling pathetic. It became very clear to me that I was intent on trying to find a movie about an interesting life, but I wasn't living an interesting life myself. I think that my marriage [to 'Jennifer Aniston' (qv)] had something to do with it. Trying to pretend the marriage was something that it wasn't.", "[2011, on 'Angelina Jolie' (qv)] One of the greatest, smartest things I ever did was give my kids Angie as their mom. She is such a great mom. Oh, man, I'm so happy to have her.", "[2011, on learning to be a parent] I was surprised at how automatic it is, how much of it is instinctual. And now I have a great confidence and trust in those instincts. I mean, one sound at night and you're awake and up because they may need you. Or when they start to have a tantrum, you know to divert them from spinning out by helping them focus on something. It just goes on and on. I tell them, \"You can make a mess, but you've got to clean it up.\".", "[2011, on his religious upbringing] I had my problems with it. It doesn't work for me. I had a lot of questions. But to get to that point where I actually questioned something that I'd based my life on - it wasn't until I was 20 that I really started separating from it, knowing that the ideas didn't make sense. I remember this scary moment where I didn't have anything to pin my existence on, to be comforted by. At the same time, it didn't work for me, man. I had to go up against this thing. I've since... My family accepts me for who I am and they worry for me because I'm gonna burn in an eternal pit of fire. But...", "[on the stress of filming _Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)_ (qv)] One day, it broke me... I called David Geffen, who was a producer... I said, \"David, I can't do this anymore. I can't do it. How much will it take to get me out?\". And he goes, very calmly, \"Forty million dollars.\".", "[on playing the leading character in _The Tree of Life (2011)_ (qv)] That's certainly not my father. But I do understand the father-knows-best mentality, the oppression the father figure can have on his kids, the pressure he is under to be the leader and provide, and feeling like he's falling short and having wants and desires himself. The tragedy is coming home and bringing that on the kids, and then feeling bad about it. It's just this vicious cycle.", "[on the Academy 'Awards' (qv) nomination process] I've been around long enough to know it's very fickle and it's a cyclical wheel. But I will say this: it's surprisingly fun when your number comes up.", "[2012: while accepting the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for _Moneyball (2011)_ (qv) and _The Tree of Life (2011)_ (qv)] This is a really big honor for me, considering I'm a guy who had never ridden in an airplane until I was 25. That first trip was here in 1989 to New York. I had an audition for a soap opera. But I had to put myself up, and I stayed at a friend's apartment. That apartment was in the Village on Christopher Street. My first impression of the city was: my god, there's a lot of guys around here. But they're so nice. This is a real pleasure for me to see some of the faces behind the formidable names that instill such fear and reverence in the film industry, although I thought you'd be taller. We are complex, we are mysteries to ourselves, we are difficult to each other, we live in continual flux and instability and conflict. Christians and Muslims, Democrats and Republicans, Denby and Rudin.", "I grew up very religious, and I don't have a great relationship with religion. I oscillate between agnosticism and atheism.", "[2012: on whether he would consider becoming a director] No, not a chance. It makes sense on some level, but I really enjoy being a creative producer and I enjoy my day job as an actor. It's enough for me. I want to also be a dad, first and foremost. After two days it gets itchy. I miss them. I just know how I'd be. I see how much time it takes to mount the thing and put it together. It wouldn't be a good match.", "I think I'm at a point now where I feel like I can jump into anything and lay something down that's quality. Someone may be better at it - or maybe not - but I know that if I have a feeling for it, then I can make it interesting. But even more as I get older, it's about the company that I keep. That's the most important thing to me - that if I'm gonna spend however long it takes to make a movie, give up 14 hours a day for however many weeks or months, then it's very important for me to know that I'm working with people who I respect and enjoy and that we're going for something together.", "[on _World War Z (2013)_ (qv)] We liked this idea of taking a genre and using that as, I guess, a metaphor for pandemics, and if one of those pandemics jumped the tracks. Would we be ready? What countries would be in better shape, what countries would take the biggest hit? A movie is only good if it speaks about our time, if it's personal in some way, and it plugs into the zeitgeist to irritate a little bit. I think we got that here.", "[2012, on _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv)] Jesse James is absolutely one of my favourites, and I think the more it decants the better it gets. About three other people think that as well, but I think it's got legs. It's elegant. 'Andrew Dominik' (qv) is a phenomenal director.", "[on _The Devil's Own (1997)_ (qv)] We had no script. Well, we had a great script but it got tossed for various reasons. To have to make something up as you go along - Jesus, what pressure! It was ridiculous. It was the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking - if you can even call it that - that I've ever seen. The movie was the complete victim of this drowning studio head ('Mark Canton' (qv)) who said, \"I don't care. We're making it. I don't care what you have. Shoot something.\"", "Terrence's Voyage of Time is an incredibly beautiful and unique experiential IMAX film for children and families chronicling the birth of time, I'm very grateful to be part of such a fascinating and educational project, but I'm currently focused on my family situation and don't want to distract attention away from this extraordinary film, which I encourage everyone to see.", "[_Real Time with Bill Maher (2003)_ (qv), August 14, 2009] Because for a democracy to work, we have to know the facts to make an informed decision. Then yes, I see it. But when you see it devolving into talks of socialism and the dismantling of the country, no one is helped by this. And let me tell you, I guarantee you these people have never been to a socialist country. I've been to a socialist country. We're fine. We're great.", "[on _A River Runs Through It (1992)_ (qv)] That was a big deal. I grew up on Redford films and Newman films and 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) and a lot of the Westerns. It was a beautiful story and one I understood because of how I grew up. 'Robert Redford' (qv) made a quality movie. But I don't think I was skilled enough. I think I could have done better. Maybe it was the pressure of the part, and playing someone who was a real person - and the family was around occasionally - and not wanting to let Redford down. But again, it's been a long time since I've seen it. I was much more critical then. I was more self-conscious."], "salary history": ["_Less Than Zero (1987)_ (qv)::$38", "_Cutting Class (1989)_ (qv)::$12,000", "_Thelma & Louise (1991)_ (qv)::$6,000", "_Kalifornia (1993)_ (qv)::$500,000", "_Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)_ (qv)::$3,000,000", "_Se7en (1995)_ (qv)::$4,000,000", "_Sleepers (1996)_ (qv)::$10,000,000", "_The Devil's Own (1997)_ (qv)::$8,000,000", "_Seven Years in Tibet (1997)_ (qv)::$10,000,000", "_Meet Joe Black (1998)_ (qv)::$17,500,000", "_Fight Club (1999)_ (qv)::$17,500,000", "_The Mexican (2001)_ (qv)::$10,000,000", "_Spy Game (2001)_ (qv)::$17,500,000", "_Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv)::$30,000,000 ($10m salary + backend participations)", "_Troy (2004)_ (qv)::$17,500,000", "_Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)_ (qv)::$20,000,000", "_The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv)::$1,000,000", "_Inglourious Basterds (2009)_ (qv)::$10,000,000", "_Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019)_ (qv)::$10,000,000"], "birth date": "1963-12-18", "birth notes": "Shawnee, Oklahoma, USA", "_actorID": "52", "_source": "IMDB", "actorID": "0000093", "created_utc_dt": "08/26/2019, 21:54:23"}
