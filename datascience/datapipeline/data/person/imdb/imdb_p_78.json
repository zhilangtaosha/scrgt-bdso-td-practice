His older brother, Dan, was born in 1950. A middle brother died at birth in 1953. His father's job required him to move regularly, which caused Kevin to feel like an Army kid, always the new kid at school, which led to him being a daydreamer. As a teen, he sang in the Baptist church choir, wrote poetry, and took writing classes. At 18, he built his own canoe and paddled his way down the rivers that Lewis & Clark followed to the Pacific. Despite his present height, he was only 5'2\" when he graduated high school. Nonetheless, he still managed to be a basketball, football and baseball star. In 1973, he enrolled at California State University at Fullerton, where he majored in business. During that period, Kevin decided to take acting lessons five nights a week. He graduated with a business degree in 1978 and married his college sweetheart, 'Cindy Costner' (qv). He initially took a marketing job in Orange County. Everything changed when he accidentally met 'Richard Burton' (qv) on a flight from Mexico. Burton advised him to go completely after acting if that is what he wanted. He quit his job and moved to Hollywood soon after. He drove a truck, worked on a deep sea fishing boat, and gave bus tours to stars' homes before finally making his own way into the films. After making one soft core sex film, he vowed to not work again if that was the only work he could do. He didn't work for nearly six years, while he waited for a proper break. That break came with _The Big Chill (1983)_ (qv), even though his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor -- he was remembered by director 'Lawrence Kasdan' (qv) when he decided to make _Silverado (1985)_ (qv).

Twice in my career - and people don't know this - I took a year off. If you look at my filmography, I probably have fewer movies than anybody else in my category. If you did the math on movies, I think you'd be shocked that mine might be a third of what other people do.", "[on _A Perfect World (1993)_ (qv)] I read it; I thought that the writer....the muse was working perfectly on his shoulder. I was really happy to be in that movie and play that character and say those words. I learned a lot from Clint and Clint was able to understand that I had some stuff to do, playing a very flawed character.", "My movies are isolated. They all sit by themselves a little bit. I don't have three movies coming along behind each other just in case one of them doesn't work. I haven't tried to manipulate my career. I wouldn't really know how to do that. That doesn't seem very heroic to me! Meaning it feels kinda chicken. That's kinda chickenshit.", "[at 'Whitney Houston' (qv)'s funeral] I urge us all, inside and outside, across the nation and around the world, to dry our tears, suspend our sorrow and perhaps our anger just long enough, just long enough to remember the sweet miracle of Whitney.", "[on playing dress-up] I'm not a guy who likes Halloween. So I'm a little at odds with what I've chosen to do with my life. I never liked going to a party dressed as a pirate because when you get past that initial \"Ooh, you're a pirate!\", you feel a little silly for threat of the party. Putting on the guns, letting the beard go and getting a pipe? That is fun. You look at everybody and wink and say, \"Man, I have one of the great jobs in the world.\".", "The opening weekend is a hard one for me. Especially when you take a lot of time with a movie. I don't know how it is with other people's movies. It's like, you don't know how other people make love because you've only made love yourself and so unless you've watched them, how do you know if you're doing it right? I know how I try to make a movie; I know how I lose sleep over it; I know how I deliberate for hours over the difference between saying 'She went over there' or saying 'She's gone'. And people will ask say, \"What's the difference, Kevin?\" Well, it's a big difference to me, to find that exactly right line. And when you work hard on things like that, it's frustrating to me that a movie can be dismissed so easily. These movies for me are like the same kind of pictures my Mom put up on the refrigerator. I'm really proud of them and if they get dismissed, and even though you're not eight years old anymore, it hurts.", "[on funding _Black or White (2014)_ (qv) himself] 'Mike Binder' (qv) sent me Black or White, and it reminded me of everything that I like about screenplays. It was very similar to _Field of Dreams (1989)_ (qv), it was very similar to _Silverado (1985)_ (qv) - it was quality, just quality writing. To me, it's the same movie as _Dances with Wolves (1990)_ (qv). I think it's a powerful movie, I think it's very commercial. I think it smells like everything that studios want, which is money - and that's not bad. I don't think artistic and financial things are mutually exclusive. I couldn't get anybody to see what I saw in it. I literally walked into my own den and looked at my wife and said, 'I think I'm gonna pay for this movie', and she said 'Really?' and then she said 'If you think that's what you should do, then that's what you should do'. And I do feel that it's a movie to be seen, and a movie to be talked about - without trying. It doesn't preach, but it's quite humorous and ultimately very poignant. The studios are making the kinds of movies they want to make. They understand their business, but I have to equally understand my business of what I choose to do, and this has as much value as anything that I could imagine doing. I couldn't minimize it, and I wouldn't allow it to be minimized. The studios didn't fail; I would have failed if I didn't toughen up and just figure out how to do it. I think it would've been a sad thing if people didn't get to see this movie. That's how much I actually believed in it.", "There's so much about _The Postman (1997)_ (qv) that I love. I probably made a mistake with Postman: I should've started it with, \"Once upon a time,\" because it's a modern-day fairytale. It wraps itself up with a storybook ending with the statue. I liked it very much.", "Every year, I mark off two weeks in June for Omaha. People ask me why. It's for the College World Series. I like to attend if Cal State Fullerton makes it. It's one of the best sporting events in the country. I highly recommend everyone to attend it at least once in their lifetime.", "It would take a lot for me to vote for a Republican these days. My views don't line up with what they believe. I believe in civil rights, gun control, protecting the environment, affordable education, not fighting in all these wars, fair taxation and the Republicans take stances opposite of my views on almost all those issues.", "I grew up in Orange County, a very Republican area at the time. My parents were Republicans. I participated in Young Republicans in college. I voted for Reagan and Bush Sr. However, I looked more and more at my own beliefs and they just didn't line up with Republican ideology. I changed my affiliation to independent after I voted for 'Bill Clinton' (qv) in 1992. These days, I would call myself a moderate Democrat, but I'm still registered as an independent.", "[on what makes a great western] Most westerns are not good. They understand the black hat and the white hat, but they don't get the dilemmas people moving across the country faced. A really good western creates a level of drama that's so random and absolute that, in the dark, you measure yourself against the women who survived out there and think, Would I have made it?", "(On _Platoon (1986)_ (qv)) The one role that I regret refusing. My brother Dan was a Marine in Vietnam and had a problem with Vietnam movies that show vets as wigged-out guys. He's very proud that he came back, went to college and has a family. In fact, Platoon was real and right. But my consciousness was with my brother."], "salary history": ["_Bull Durham (1988)_ (qv)::$1,500,000", "_Dances with Wolves (1990)_ (qv)::$3,000,000", "_JFK (1991)_ (qv)::$7,000,000", "_Waterworld (1995)_ (qv)::$14,000,000 + percentage of gross", "_Thirteen Days (2000)_ (qv)::$15,000,000", "_Dragonfly (2002)_ (qv)::$15,000,000"], "birth date": "1955-01-18", "birth notes": "Lynwood, California, USA", "_actorID": "78", "_source": "IMDB", "actorID": "0000126", "created_utc_dt": "08/26/2019, 21:54:39"}
