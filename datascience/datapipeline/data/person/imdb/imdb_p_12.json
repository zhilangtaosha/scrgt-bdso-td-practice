He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named 'The Kids'. However, it was when he married Lori Anne Allison ('Lori A. Depp' (qv)) that he took up the job of being a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor 'Nicolas Cage' (qv), who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp's film debut in the low-budget horror film, _A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)_ (qv), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced 'Jeff Yagher' (qv) in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series _21 Jump Street (1987)_ (qv).In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director 'Tim Burton' (qv) came about when Depp played the title role in _Edward Scissorhands (1990)_ (qv). Following the film's success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of _Ed Wood (1994)_ (qv). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), opposite 'Al Pacino' (qv); in 1998 he appeared in _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)_ (qv), directed by 'Terry Gilliam' (qv); and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film _The Astronaut's Wife (1999)_ (qv). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in _Sleepy Hollow (1999)_ (qv), brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane.Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in _From Hell (2001)_ (qv). He stole the show from screen greats such as 'Antonio Banderas' (qv) in the finale to 'Robert Rodriguez' (qv)'s \"mariachi\" trilogy, _Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003)_ (qv). In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)_ (qv), playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film's enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the 'Stephen King' (qv)-based movie, _Secret Window (2004)_ (qv); as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based _Finding Neverland (2004)_ (qv), where he co-starred with 'Kate Winslet' (qv); and Rochester in the British film, _The Libertine (2004)_ (qv). Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of 'Roald Dahl' (qv)'s novel, _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)_ (qv), and later in _Alice in Wonderland (2010)_ (qv) and _Dark Shadows (2012)_ (qv).Off-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to 'Sherilyn Fenn' (qv), 'Jennifer Grey' (qv), 'Winona Ryder' (qv) and 'Kate Moss' (qv). He was married to Lori Anne Allison in 1983, but divorced her in 1985. Depp has two children with French singer/actress 'Vanessa Paradis' (qv): Lily-Rose Melody, born in 1999 and Jack, born in 2002.

In a way your body is a journal and the scars are sort of entries in it.", "I can remember my parents fighting and us kids wondering who was going to go with whom if they got divorced.", "[about his first marriage] I guess I have very traditional kinds of sensibilities about that kind of stuff - you know, a man and a woman sharing their life together and having a baby, whatever - and I think for a while I was trying to right the wrongs of my parents because they split up when I was a kid, so I thought I could do it differently - make things work. I had the right intentions, but the wrong timing - and the wrong person. But I don't regret it; I had fun and I learned a lot.", "You know, I was married, when I was 20. It was a strong bond with someone, but I can't necessarily say I was in love. That's something that comes around once, man, maybe twice if you're lucky.

Lemme do it!\"", "[about _A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)_ (qv)] I was just not what [director 'Wes Craven' (qv)] had written for the story. He had written the part of a big, blond, beach jock, football player guy. And I was sort of emaciated, with old hairspray and spiky hair, earrings, a little catacomb dweller.

There were so many bands it was impossible to make any money. So we all got side jobs. We used to sell ads over the telephone. Telemarketing. We got $100 a week. We had to rip people off. We'd tell them they'd been chosen by so-and-so in their area to receive a grandfather clock. They would order $500 worth of these fucking things and we would send them a cheap grandfather clock. It was horrible.", "I like to think that I'm very considerate of other people's feelings, and I was trained as a small child to always try my best at everything. I think I'm a mixture of romantic and realist. I'm a realist about some stuff, but I also wholeheartedly believe that in a society where people get divorced every five minutes you can still stay married for 50 or 75 years. It's been done and it's beautiful. When I see a couple celebrating their 75th wedding anniversary, I just think that it's totally incredible.", "(About his early relationship) I don't regret any of them. I had a good time. Most of what's been written about me has been completely false. People have created an image that has absolutely nothing to do with me, and they have the power to sell it, to shove it down the throats of people.

I read for him and he said, \"OK, I need you for ten weeks in the jungle.\" It was a great experience.", "I made some shitty movies when I was first starting out, but I'm not embarrassed by them, especially as I didn't think I was going to be an actor - I was just trying to make some money. I was still a musician. When I first started out I was just given the opportunity, and there was no other way to make that kind of money. Apart from crime.

And as far as I was concerned, when 'Stephen Sondheim' (qv) writes the note and it has to be held for this many beats, you do it. I don't care if you're from Miramar or Kentucky or you're an ass and you don't sing. It doesn't matter. Don't be a pussy, you fucking hold that note. You can't cheat. You can't whisper. You can't do the 'William Shatner' (qv) thing. You just gotta belt it out. So I really beat myself up, making sure I could hold those notes. In \"Johanna,\" some are, like, twelve beats. That was a bugger. At one point, I was very close to passing out-- I got dizzy and saw black. But that's what Sondheim wrote, so that's what you do.", "(About teen magazines) They had come to me in the beginning and said, \"We want you to do these interviews and stuff for these magazines,\" and I said, \"What magazines?\" And they said, \"Sixteen!

The only thing I have in common with Tom Hanson is that we look alike.", "(About 21 Jump Street) I got a call from my agents, who said, \"These people want you to come and read for this TV thing.\" And I said, \"No, no, no, no, no\". I didn't want to sign some big contract that would bind me for years. So they hired somebody else to do it, and they fired him after about a month, and then they called me again and said, \"Would you please come in and do it?\" My agent said, \"The average span of a TV series is thirteen episodes, if that. One season.\" So I said OK.", "When I see someone who just follows their dream and succeeds, and just does basically what they want to do and doesn't have to answer to anyone, obviously not harming anyone, that's great.", "Now it's starting to get to profound [things]. She sat me down the other day, sort of like, \"Dad, I need to have a talk with you.\" You know, she's four. I said, \"Alright sweetheart, what do you got?\" She said, \"I just want to ask you three questions.\" I said, \"Ok, what do you got?\" She said, \"Is God afraid of dogs?\" I thought about it. I said, \"No honey, I don't think he is. Probably not.\" She said, \"Ok. Has He seen the dinosaurs?\" I said, \"Yes, I think he has.\" And then she said, \"Does God have a maid?\" And I didn't know how to answer it!", "(About 21 Jump Street) I'm afraid I started navel-gazing.

And I only get to say my own for 90 days.", "Kids write to me and say they are having these problems or they want to commit suicide or something. It's scary.

But I'm not altogether stable myself, so who am I to give advice?", "It's scary. It's terrifying. People come up to you and start crying. Everybody compares everyone to 'James Dean' (qv) these days.

They invite you to put on an instant image.", "(About teen magazines) Those are things that are out of my control. It's very nice to be appreciated, but I'm not really comfortable with it. I've never liked being the centre of attention. It comes with the territory.", "(about his high school) I was around 15 when I left. I went back 2 weeks later, thinking \"You know what, this is crazy, I should go back.\" So I went back, and I talked to the dean of the school, and he said, \"Johnny... we don't *want* you to come back.\" He said, it was really sweet actually, \"You have this music thing, I think you should run with it.

I get instant religion during takeoff, then when we're safely in the air I sit there thinking about the fact that any little thing that goes wrong could send us crashing to the ground.", "(On growing up) We moved like gypsies. From the time I was five until my teens we lived in 30 or 40 different houses. That probably has a lot to do with my transient life now. But it's how I was raised so I thought there was nothing abnormal about it. Wherever the family is, that's home. We lived in apartments, on a farm, in a motel. Then we rented a house, and one night we moved from there to the house next door. I remember carrying my clothes across the yard and thinking, This is weird, but it's an easy move.", "(1996 - On fame) If there's anything I really want, it's privacy. You do get to where your money can help your family, and that's a great thing. You can buy that wristwatch you want, too. But mostly you now have to pay for simplicity. You use your money to buy privacy because during most of your life you aren't allowed to be normal. You're on display, always looked at, which puts you at a disadvantage for the people looking at you know that it's you. They say, \"It's you!\" But you don't know them. That's bad for an actor because the most important thing you can do is observe people. And now you can't because you're the one being observed.", "(On first seeing himself on-screen) I got sick. I went to see dailies on _A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)_ (qv). I was 21, and didn't know what was going on. It was like looking in a huge mirror. It wasn't how I looked that bothered me, though I did look like a geek in that movie. It was seeing myself up there pretending.", "(Joking about 'Ryan Reynolds' (qv) taking over the title \"Sexiest Man Alive 2010\") I feel emasculated. I feel like I've been beaten down like some horrible ... you know, like some pathetic harp seal. But, I mean, that's how it goes, isn't it? I think I can work my way forward, but will I try for it again? No. ...

That's why people don't read any more. They don't chew their own food. They just want to swallow it, get it fucking down then move on.

Just full steam ahead. {Maybe a geriatric Jack?] Yeah, I think they could wheel me in. Interestingly enough, with a character like Captain Jack, you just feel you could continue. The possibilities are endless, limitless. There's any possibility of madness and absurdity that could commence. With this character you feel that you're never really done.", "[on a scene involving a flight through the streets of London] It was horrible. It was gruelling. I've done many things in my life under the influence of - life - but I'd never actually thought of straddling two carriages while they're moving and then of jumping on people's heads and then onto another sort of cart.

It just clicked instantly, so whatever exists in terms of chemistry was just firing instantly on all cylinders. It felt completely right.", "[on 'Hunter S. Thompson' (qv)] The beauty with Hunter was that there was a very profound element of trust between us.

It was not anything very near to my brain or my heart, which is how it pretty much remains to this day. But 'Wes Craven' (qv) was brave enough to give me the gig based on his daughter's opinion. I guess she had read with a bunch of actors, and after the casting sessions, she said, \"No, that's the guy.\" I always think of her for putting me in this mess, and certainly 'Wes Craven' (qv) for being brave enough to give me this gig.

Part of the process that I've always enjoyed is being the observer. You know, just watching people and learning. At a certain point, the reversal took place.
