He was very frightened that we would come out with these 2-D characters, and I was amazed at how helpful they were, the images more than the story.

The way Wolverine stands and how he looks.", "[on Wolverine video game] I didn't do the motion-capture work; I didn't do any of that.

It's far more dangerous than a video game.", "[on playing Wolverine] The character I play is actually only 1.6 meters [5' 3\"]. Before I had any kind of acting profile I was encouraged to lie about my height. I was told to say I was about six foot [1.83 meters] tall. I was worried about it when I first had my audition because pleasing fans of the franchise is important. My height was brought up on the Internet. They didn't think it was right. A lot of people who never met me think I'm very short. 'James Marsden' (qv) (Cyclops), who's only 10 centimeters [4 inches] shorter than me, was put on boxes and platforms in our scenes together. You'll notice that every character in _X-Men (2000)_ (qv) looks taller than me.", "I've always felt that if you back down from a fear, the ghost of that fear never goes away. It diminishes people.

It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career.

It's weird how it evolved.", "I can look back on my life, where there have been moments where things might have gone the other way.

I treasure them most.", "[on the look he wanted for _X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)_ (qv)] I had this image in my head of De Niro in that remake of _Cape Fear (1991)_ (qv). You were terrified of that character from the moment he took his shirt off and you saw all the tats; you know he was this coiled spring that would rip your head off, no matter how nonchalant he acted. That's who Wolverine is.", "The things that I really cherish are the everyday moments, like sitting around cooking pancakes together on Sunday morning, or getting home after a tough day and my kids come up and give me a hug and remind me what's really important.", "[on _Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012)_ (qv)] 'Victor Hugo' (qv)'s novel is the greatest handbook any actor ever had for a job.

I think rugby saved me because that's just organized violence.", "Nine out of 10 characteristics of Wolverine I don't share, but aggression is a primal thing and needs to be exercised in some way. When I was younger I was very explosive. I used to let most of it out playing rugby. I'm not as explosive now but in a sense it's still there. It's in our DNA ... far better to have it in a controlled violent environment. So in a way playing Wolverine is good therapy.", "[on persistent rumors that he is gay despite being married to 'Deborra-Lee Furness' (qv) for 17 years] If I was, I would be. I don't think - to me, it's not the most interesting thing about a person anyway, but I do get frustrated for Deb, because I see Deb go, 'Ah, this is crazy.' On some level it's a compliment, you know, because it only happens when you've got to a certain point in your career.", "[on Australians working in Hollywood] We dominate! We're the majority now! It's always good to be an Aussie wherever you are...it's because Hollywood accepts us. Aussies over there they just love them, they love the accent, they want to know everything about you, they really dig the Aussies. It's a good time to be an Aussie, I'm real proud of all the Aussies and real credit to how in Australia we train actors really well, and in general how Aussies will have a go and aren't afraid to pack up and have a crack.", "I understand at Marvel they've got The Avengers, they've got a lot of big things going on, but at some point I just find it almost impossible that there's not a way to bring Iron Man, all the Avengers characters, Wolverine, the X-Men characters, Spider-Man, and somehow get them in together.", "I just heard Oscar, my son who's thirteen, telling a friend, 'Enough about my dad, all right? The truth is he's nothing like Wolverine. He's not cool, he's not tough, he's nothing like that'.", "I'm a typical actor. Someone picks me up in the morning, they give me something to wear, tell me what to say, feed me and send me home.", "[on coping with the ultra-Scottish tradition of his Sydney school] I wasn't a bag-pipe guy, but I was a kilt guy - and had to endure endless ribbing on the train. Every Friday, if you were in the cadets, the school army - you had to wear the kilt. It wasn't traditional kilt-wearing: there was underwear involved. Just to clear that up for everybody.", "[on maintaining privacy in his life] With paparazzi, I'm constantly trying to see my kids' view of the situation - that if I start flipping the bird or throwing punches how frightening it would be for them. So I'm constantly sitting on it? Yeah. Would I like to handle it differently? Yes.", "[on casting challenges] The risk for me is constantly being considered Mr. Nice Guy, Mr. Wholesome. Labels are the enemy. I'm particularly drawn this character [Kelly Dover in _Prisoners_], maybe as a parent. I love looking at how people react under almost melodramatically extreme situations. As an actor, that's the ultimate stretch.", "[on preparing to play \"Keller Dover\" in _Prisoners (2013)_ (qv)] All the research I did was about sleep deprivation, because the movie takes place over eight or nine days. And when I read something from a father whose kid was gone, he said that the most maddening part of the whole thing is the powerlessness of the parent, knowing that the child is waiting for you and can't understand why you're not there, every second of every day. The idea of sleep or rest is impossible.", "[re working in _Prisoners (2013)_ (qv) with director 'Denis Villeneuve' (qv)] The common thing in cases like these is the ticking clock.

It was ultimately very freeing.", "_Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv) blew my mind. I had no idea movies could be that great and awesome. I was 12 years old, and that's when I remember thinking, 'Oh, I'd love to do that one day.'", "[on the _Logan (2017)_ (qv)] If I did another one I'm 99.9% sure it would be the last, so that will inform what it is for me.", "[on his recurring bouts of skin cancer] I'm realistic about the future and it's more than likely that I'll have at least one more but probably many more, which is not uncommon for an Aussie particularly from English stock growing up in Australia where I don't remember ever being told to put sunscreen on. But the beauty of this is it's all preventable, it's just about getting proper check-ups. I can be typical man, a little lazy, I couldn't be bothered and now I'm not lazy at all.", "[on playing Wolverine] I love the character. I love the series. I would never take it for granted or do it for the hell of it. I have to feel like I really have something to offer and we're going to take Wolverine on a slightly different journey. Otherwise it'll be time to hand over the claws to someone else, and I'm sure there will be many lining up to do it.", "[on watching _X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)_ (qv) with his kids] It is actually really cool to watch it with them until you get to the moment where you're naked on screen and you forgot to warn your almost nine-year-old daughter. And she says, 'Dad, why aren't you wearing underwear?'", "[observation, 2012] I believe this is the 2,487th star on the Walk of Fame.

I worked on my abs for months [for Wolverine], but there was a similar intensity preparing to play Jean Valjean.", "[on possibly integrating Irish mythology into the _Logan (2017)_ (qv)] So travel back to Ireland and proper investigate Logan's past. Shake things up. I guarantee you, there's some Irish blood in there. And I loved the myths and legends.
