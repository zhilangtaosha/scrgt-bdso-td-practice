The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to fame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy _In Living Color (1990)_ (qv) but leading roles in _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)_ (qv), _Dumb and Dumber (1994)_ (qv) and _The Mask (1994)_ (qv) established him as a bankable comedy actor.James Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname was originally \"Carr\u00e9\", and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child, he performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to The 'Carol Burnett' (qv) Show (1967) at age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the end of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates (provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).Carrey's early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when the family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to Scarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial jobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after school let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered). When they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a Volkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.Carrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and siblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful) professional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk's, one of the many local clubs that would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He dropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations (among them 'Michael Landon' (qv) and 'James Stewart' (qv)), and in 1979 worked up the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular gig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed 'Rodney Dangerfield' (qv) so much that the veteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During this period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he had a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy divorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress 'Lauren Holly' (qv). Wary of falling into the lounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance outlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived sitcom _The Duck Factory (1984)_ (qv); while the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to pursue acting more vigorously.Carrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored the male lead in the ill-received 'Lauren Hutton' (qv) vehicle _Once Bitten (1985)_ (qv), and had a supporting role in _Peggy Sue Got Married (1986)_ (qv), before making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc in _Earth Girls Are Easy (1988)_ (qv). Impressed with Carrey's lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial 'Damon Wayans' (qv) made a call to his brother, 'Keenen Ivory Wayans' (qv), who was in the process of putting together the sketch comedy show _In Living Color (1990)_ (qv). Carrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with outrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire Marshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill- advised safety tips).Following his time on _In Living Color (1990)_ (qv), Carrey's transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened within the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn in _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)_ (qv), a film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the character's trademark was talking out his derri\u00e8re). Next up was the manic superhero movie _The Mask (1994)_ (qv), which had audiences wondering just how far Carrey's features could stretch.Finally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the Farrelly brothers' _Dumb and Dumber (1994)_ (qv) (his first multi-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought his manic antics onto the set of _Batman Forever (1995)_ (qv), replacing 'Robin Williams' (qv) as The Riddler. He also filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough, _Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995)_ (qv), and inked a deal with Sony to star in _The Cable Guy (1996)_ (qv) (replacing 'Chris Farley' (qv)) for a cool $20 million--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been offered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a disappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced back the next year with the energetic hit _Liar Liar (1997)_ (qv). Worried that his comic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.In 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in 'Peter Weir' (qv)'s _The Truman Show (1998)_ (qv) playing a naive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a TV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took moviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and fans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn't materialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their narrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey threw himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a handful of other hopefuls (including 'Edward Norton' (qv)) to play eccentric funnyman 'Andy Kaufman' (qv) in _Man on the Moon (1999)_ (qv), Carrey disappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery alter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman's bongo drums, which he'd used during his audition for director 'Milos Forman' (qv)). His sometimes uncanny impersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again the Academy kept quiet.An indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly brothers in _Me, Myself & Irene (2000)_ (qv), playing a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with the same woman ('Ren\u00e9e Zellweger' (qv)). Carrey's real-life persona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film wrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then, Carrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy antihero of 'Ron Howard' (qv)'s _How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)_ (qv).Although Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films such as _Bruce Almighty (2003)_ (qv) and _Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011)_ (qv), he is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as demonstrated in films like _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)_ (qv) and the drama/comedy _Yes Man (2008)_ (qv). In 2013, he costars with 'Steve Carell' (qv) in _The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013)_ (qv).Carrey has one child with his first wife, 'Melissa Carrey' (qv), whom he divorced in 1995. He married actress 'Lauren Holly' (qv) in 1996, but they split less than a year later.::Kage Fuusha and Anonymous"], "spouse": ["'Lauren Holly' (qv)::(23 September 1996 - 29 July 1997) ( divorced)", "'Melissa Carrey' (qv)::(28 March 1987 - 11 December 1995) ( divorced) ( 1 child)"], "trade mark": ["Flexible body movements", "Frequently plays a character who wears green or is green", "Makes weird facial expressions in his more comical roles.

It definitely put me in a weird place.", "Even if I am being over the top or crazy, I want to do something original. There is nothing that makes me happier than when someone says: 'I watched _The Mask (1994)_ (qv) 300 times when I was a kid.' I look forward to when I am 80 and people come up to me going: 'It was you, dude.' That's an amazing feeling.", "It is as if I am starting out every time I make a film. And I swear to you I don't feel any more secure than I used to, or jaded in any way. There was a moment when I thought 'I am not sure I want to be part of this big thing that is Hollywood.' I looked at it cynically for a minute. Then I sat on my couch and realized the value of what I do. We free people from concern. It is what everyone needs in this day and age. There is nothing better and it started out that way.", "I was always trying to make my mother laugh because she was sick or depressed or whatever. Many comics start out by trying to heal their family. That's how you get good. Your drunken grandparents leave and you turn around as a seven-year-old child and imitate them. That is how it began for me, bringing comic relief to my family. It really is comic relief, people don't just want to see it, they need it. I need it more than they do and that is why I am on this side of the camera because I am a really needy person.", "(2001, on his first comedy show) My mother dressed me in a polyester suit, and I got booed off the stage, and I didn't go back for two years. But then when I went back, I was gangbusters.", "My focus is to forget the pain, mock the pain, reduce it.", "[on Ireland] I love the whole culture, obviously. You have the best musicians, the best poets. Great artists come out of Ireland.", "These mass shootings and daily body counts are an invitation for us to become more civilized and to deal with our addiction and entitlement to violence. Not to shut our eyes and ears and scream at those with a different opinion than ours to 'fuck off and go back to Canada'.", "So many of us chose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. My father could have been a great comedian, but he didn't believe that was possible for him. So, he made a conservative choice and instead he got a job as an accountant. When I was 12 years old, he was let go from that safe job. Our family had to do whatever we could to survive. I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which is that you can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.", "(Why he turned down _Phone Booth (2002)_ (qv)) I just wasn't in the right space to do that movie. I'd just come off _Me, Myself & Irene (2000)_ (qv) and _How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)_ (qv). I didn't want to go to a phone both and think about dying.", "[on 'Jerry Lewis' (qv)] People might dismiss Jerry as someone who acted the fool. But the fool is not an idiot.The courage and freedom of the fool liberates us. The fool tells the truth while making fun of our arrogance and our conventional ideas. He shows us up for what we are, and that's what Jerry did. He was a blessing.", "[on the nuclear alert in Hawaii on January 13, 2018] It was a false alarm, but a real psychic warning.

We have socialized medicine, and I am here to tell you that this bullshit line that you get on all the political shows from people, is that it's a failure; the system is a failure in Canada. It is NOT a failure in Canada. I never waited for anything in my life, I chose my own doctors, my mother never paid for a prescription. It was fantastic. And I just got back from Vancouver, and I keep hearing this, \"Canadians are so nice . . . Canadians are so nice.\" They can be nice because they have health care. Because they have a government that cares about them. It doesn't say, \"Sink or fucking swim pal, or you live in a box.\" There are certain people in our society that need to be taken care of. There are people without as many opportunities that need to be helped toward those opportunities. There are people who are sick. You shouldn't have to lose your home because your mother got sick.", "I feel that we're all lighthouses, and my job is to shine my light as brightly as I can to the darkness.", "Whoever invented marriage was creepy as hell.
