His mother, Chris Anne (n\u00e9e Boldt), is a school teacher, and his father, Timothy Byers Affleck, is a social worker; the two are divorced. Ben has a younger brother, actor 'Casey Affleck' (qv), who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, G\u00e9za, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.Affleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series, _The Voyage of the Mimi (1984)_ (qv). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, 'Matt Damon' (qv). They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including _Hands of a Stranger (1987)_ (qv) and _The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988)_ (qv). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in _Dazed and Confused (1993)_ (qv). After that, he did mostly independent films like 'Kevin Smith' (qv)'s _Mallrats (1995)_ (qv) and _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) which were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), they gave it to their agent, 'Patrick Whitesell' (qv), who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend 'Kevin Smith' (qv) who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy 'Awards' (qv) and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.Affleck chose such roles in the blockbusters _Armageddon (1998)_ (qv), _Shakespeare in Love (1998)_ (qv), and _Pearl Harbor (2001)_ (qv). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits _Changing Lanes (2002)_ (qv), _The Sum of All Fears (2002)_ (qv), and _Daredevil (2003)_ (qv), as well as the disappointing comedies _Gigli (2003)_ (qv) and _Surviving Christmas (2004)_ (qv). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in _Hollywoodland (2006)_ (qv). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films _Smokin' Aces (2006)_ (qv), _He's Just Not That Into You (2009)_ (qv), _State of Play (2009)_ (qv), and _Extract (2009)_ (qv). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), which starred his brother, 'Casey Affleck' (qv), and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in _The Town (2010)_ (qv), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller _Argo (2012)_ (qv), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck's second Oscar win).In 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller _Gone Girl (2014)_ (qv). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)_ (qv), briefly reprised the character in _Suicide Squad (2016)_ (qv), and did so again in _Justice League (2017)_ (qv).Affleck married actress 'Jennifer Garner' (qv) in 2005. The couple has three children. In June 2015, Affleck and Garner separated, and in April 2017 they filed for divorce.::TrendEkiD@aol.com and Pedro Borges"], "spouse": ["'Jennifer Garner' (qv)::(29 June 2005 - 4 October 2018) ( divorced) ( 3 children)"], "trade mark": ["Frequently plays arrogant and ruthless characters", "Opens his films with narration or title cards", "Often works with brother 'Casey Affleck' (qv) and friend 'Matt Damon' (qv)", "His films often feature corrupt but well-meaning law enforcement figures", "His films often focus on characters caught in situations out of their depth", "Frequently sets his films in his hometown of Boston", "Often casts 'Titus Welliver' (qv) and 'Victor Garber' (qv)", "Square jaw", "Frequently cast by 'Kevin Smith' (qv)"], "trivia": ["Fined $135 for driving in Massachusetts with a suspended license.

I don't presume to tell anybody who to vote for. I am comfortable telling people what my opinions are. But you have to look also to the media, where you have a vast majority of the loudest and most influential political voices in America media from people who came from the entertainment world. You have 'Rush Limbaugh' (qv), was a radio disc jockey. 'Bill O'Reilly' (qv) came from _Inside Edition (1988)_ (qv). 'Michael Moore' (qv)'s a filmmaker. 'Al Franken' (qv) was on _Saturday Night Live (1975)_ (qv). The line is increasingly blurred between news and entertainment. Secondarily, the media's also shoving celebrities down our throats all the time.

I went to the Los Angeles fund raiser. I wasn't in the one in New York. I think when you have somebody -- you know, if you did a rock concert that was a benefit and 'The Who' (qv) played their music or 'The Rolling Stones' (qv), you'd expect to get, you know, \"Satisfaction\" or \"My Generation.\" When you hire 'Whoopi Goldberg' (qv), you're going to get her brand of humor. And I think there is a fine line, and you have to be a little bit mindful. And I, for one, am not going to do any scatological jokes or puns about the president's last name on your show, mostly for that reason. But I also think I expect a different code of behavior maybe from comedians who have made a career with a certain kind of comedy than I do from, oh, say, the Vice President of the United States [referring to Vice President ['Dick Cheney' (qv), who told Vermont Sen. 'Patrick Leahy' (qv) to \"Go fuck yourself\" on the floor of the Senate], who used this vulgar language, you know, to a senator and was sort of unapologetic about it. So I think the Republicans hitting her [Whoopi] too hard for that is a little bit hypocritical.", "[to 'Dee Dee Myers' (qv), when asked how people react to his campaigning for candidates he supports] Well, I mean, to be perfectly honest, probably the most effective things that celebrities do for political candidates is raise money. You know, that's something that you can do. And unlike, say, fund-raisers sponsored by -- you know, engineered by insurance companies or oil companies, at least what you can say for celebrities is they're not expecting, you know, deregulation of their industry in return. So that's one of things that I'm, I've been able to do and to try to help them do it. Other than that, you know, I've lived this sort of strange, sometimes unpleasant, but mostly very lucky life that's involved lately a lot of media attention. And one of the things that feels good to me to do is to try to steer that in a direction of something more significant and at least be -- try to create some political dialogue. And that's satisfying. Some people react to me kindly, and others don't. That's sort of the nature of politics. [Myers follows up: \"Do you think it's kind of a risk for your career as movie star to get in bed with one party?\"] Unequivocally. Absolutely. And I think that's why, you know, actually, people say, Well, you see all these celebrities. To my mind, you see very, very few. Most feel like, and probably correctly so, that to be identified with one side of the ideological fence or other risks alienating a segment of your audience that may like your movies, may want to buy your tickets, and in fact, may make it more difficult for them to suspend their disbelief when they go see you in a movie because they have you closely identified with something else. For me, part of that is already compromised, and it's also something that's interesting enough for me, and I don't care quite so much about that kind of image that I'm able to do it. But I think a lot of people shy away from it, and many celebrities you see who've gone out there, tried to be active, have gotten pretty beaten down, you know? And so I think there is a risk, yes.

Bush' (qv), after hearing that New York was under attack on Sept 11, remained in a Florida classroom, doing nothing, for several minutes] It's obviously very disturbing footage. On the one hand, you see a reaction on a man's face that he is clearly pained and shocked. I probably did the same thing sitting on my chair. I was completely freaked out and a little devastated. On the other hand, one does hope that in one's leaders, that they have the instinct to spring into action, to take some action or make the appearance of taking some action. And I was disappointed to see that he didn't do that, although I don't entirely hold it against him because, frankly, I was as shocked and devastated as he was.

He gave me this big lecture and said, \"You know how much money I made in 20 years of acting? Eight thousand dollars. And I'm a carpenter.\" He was just really unhappy and it was depressing. Then he got really stoned and I went home and felt sick. I think it was just morbid fear. I was 18. That fear stays with you so intensely and you're constantly just getting turned down for what you think of as the most vapid, stupid kind of paycheck, _Baywatch (1989)_ (qv) things, and you think, \"Jesus, if I'm not good enough for this, then I'm not going to make it\".

I lived in Hollywood, then I moved. ['Matt Damon' (qv)] and I got money from _School Ties (1992)_ (qv), and we blew it all in a couple of months. We made $35,000 or $40,000 each and thought we were rich. And we were shocked later on to find out how much we owed in taxes. We were appalled: $15,000! What? But we rented this house on the beach in Venice and 800 people came and stayed with us and got drunk. Then we ran out of money and had to get an apartment. It was like everything was exciting. So we lived in Glendale and Eagle Rock and we lived in Hollywood, West Hollywood, Venice, by the Hollywood Bowl, all over the place. We'd get thrown out of some places or we'd have to upgrade or downgrade depending on who had money.", "It's like Christmas: it's all advertising, and the first rule of selling somebody something is to make them seem inadequate.

And that's how Christmas has become, because 50% of all retail sales happen in December. You are bombarded with this stuff - money will make you happy, and keeping up with the Joneses.

I feel plagued by insecurity.", "I remember back when I was a kid there was a comic strip called Plastic Man. His body was elastic and he could make his extremities as long as he wanted. As a youngster I didn't fully appreciate. But I'm now thinking Plastic Man was probably pretty popular with the ladies.", "I hate the whole reluctant sex-symbol thing. It's such bull. You see these dudes greased up, in their underwear, talking about how they don't want to be a sex symbol.", "I kinda see my current position like this: \"Here's your five minutes in the toy store, so you gotta do all the good movies you can before 'Chuck Woolery' (qv) rings the bell\".", "When I look up at the screen and see myself I always have to laugh. Not because I think I'm doing a horrible job, quite the contrary, I just feel it's so surreal to feel like one person can entertain so many at one time.", "I just feel like sometimes I'm a force to be dealt with. My talents are sometimes overused and also sometimes underused. It's not easy being me.", "I never know what my next move will be in Hollywood. It's such an unpredictable town. People get jaded and lost and I've been able to stay a float. I think the next logical step in my career would be to start my own filmmaking empire like ['Harvey Weinstein' (qv)] and ['Bob Weinstein' (qv)] did so many years ago. I think if only the unions weren't so strict in Boston, I'd set up shop there and make films of a certain quality you don't see represented these days. I'm full of ideas and dreams.", "[asked by 'Dee Dee Myers' (qv) if he thought it was risky for his career to be identified with a particular political party] Unequivocally. Absolutely. And I think that's why, you know, actually, people say, \"Well, you see all these celebrities\". To my mind, you see very, very few. Most feel like, and probably correctly so, that to be identified with one side of the ideological fence or other risks alienating a segment of your audience that may like your movies, may want to buy your tickets, and in fact, may make it more difficult for them to suspend their disbelief when they go see you in a movie because they have you closely identified with something else. For me, part of that is already compromised, and it's also something that's interesting enough for me, and I don't care quite so much about that kind of image that I'm able to do it. But I think a lot of people shy away from it, and many celebrities you see who've gone out there, tried to be active, have gotten pretty beaten down, you know? And so I think there is a risk, yes.", "I think we don't need to know anything about a political figure's sex lives. I guess 'Matt Drudge' (qv) did break [the 'Monica Lewinsky' (qv)] story, if you think that's a story worth breaking. I think it was a story that bogged down the wheels of government for two years. I don't care, personally. Some people say that's a fair reflection of a candidate's character. I don't. I'm not voting for your sexual predilection, I'm voting for your policy positions.", "'News' (qv)papers have gotten lazy and gotten nervous and started sourcing from blogs, and that, I think, is dangerous.

I could start a blog tomorrow and write, 'I heard that so-and-so is an alien' -- a lot of false stories got started and got some currency because they were placed in blogs.", "Part of the blogging culture that's good is it's made the traditional press much more nervous. They've become more accountable, because they are sensitive to what the bloggers are going to say. Most Americans don't spend the day waiting for what the bloggers are going to say. The mainstream media sweats it, because for the first time they are actually accountable to someone who is going to write about them and their work. Which has a real strong impact on the mainstream media and how they work.", "I was no longer in control of my life. I thought I wanted certain things, but I didn't. I got lost. I felt suffocated, miserable and gross. I should never have gone down that route or got sucked in to all the publicity. I was typecast as myself. Too many people weren't getting past what they read about me. That was damaging. I can tell from experience it's bad for you, and bad for your career. So I took a break, went away for a while and let things calm down. (Claiming that his high-profile engagement with 'Jennifer Lopez' (qv) damaged his career.)", "I finally decided to quit smoking when I found out I was going to have a child. That was the thing that sort of put it over the top for me. I decided to go to a hypnotist. You sit in a chair and the hypnotist sips water and just talks to you for an hour, and explains how nicotine is poison. All of a sudden, I thought, 'This is asinine that I've been doing this to myself for all these years.'

'Christopher Nolan' (qv) is brilliant and they've got a great director for it.... Also there are a lot of guys ahead of me on the list to do epic effects movies.", "I'd love to do [direct] something like _Blade Runner (1982)_ (qv), but a lesson I've learned is to not look at movies based on budget, how much they'll spend on effects, or where they will shoot. Story is what's important.", "[on starting out as a film director] I knew how the sausage was made. Whether I could make a good sausage I didn't know. But I knew how to get into the sausage factory and stuff intestines.", "[on \"Argo\" and the relationship between Hollywood and the government] There is a symbiotic relationship. People make movies about military. When you go on a tour with the military all these guys are movie buffs. Movies are a big part of our culture. The military, the movies, and our intelligence services are inventing things. For movies, it's for art and entertainment. For intelligence services, it's for God knows what. That's one of the themes of this story: the power of storytelling, whether it's political theater, relating to our children, or trying to get people out of danger. Telling stories is incredibly powerful. There's a shot I really like where there's this firing squad, then you go to this read through, and then there's a firearm, a rifle, and a camera. Hopefully this is subtle, but that suggests the camera is more powerful than the gun. I think that's been really worn out with the Youtube era.", "[on life after 'Gigli' and 'Jersey Girl'] Unfortunately there's an aspect of (press coverage) that's like one of those fights you see on YouTube where one of them falls down and then a bunch of people, who were standing around, come over to kick the person. They don't know them, they have no involvement in the fight, but they recognize a moment that they can get a free shot in. And for some people it's just too much to resist. And that was definitely me at that point. I was the guy. I was the designated person to loathe.", "[reviewing his career, 2013] I was nobody auditioning, and then I was seen as this young, emerging talent, writer, Oscar-winner, and then I was seen as this blockbuster actor, and then I was seen as this train-wreck actor, and then I was seen as this resurgent director. And now I think I'm kind of seen as just sort of somebody in Hollywood who works.", "[on Roger Ebert's death] It just broke my heart that he had died.

Feel like I may be a better actor just for the radiation.", "[2013: Excerpt from the closing remarks of his Best Picture acceptance speech] I want to thank [The Academy] and I want to thank what they taught me, which is that you have to work harder than you think you possibly can.

All that matters is that you gotta get up.", "Having a family makes things you have that much richer. It's much nicer to share it with the people you love.", "[on _Enough Said (2013)_ (qv)] 'Nicole Holofcener' (qv)'s \"Enough Said\" is sublime. The performances and the direction are honest and restrained. She expertly coaxes the characters along through the story, and she manages to accomplish that rare feat: to make the performances so realistic you think it's a bunch of actors improvising as themselves, only to reveal a carefully constructed, interlocking story - woven expertly around profound themes. She has a graceful directorial touch. She makes space for her actors' success and seems to know precisely when they've achieved it. Her modesty as a director, her insistence not to step in front of the movie, at first serves to immerse us more fully into the film - and then pulls us from the feelings we didn't even know were there (and had been, no doubt, percolating on Ms. Holofcener's timetable all along). Her direction is void of spectacle, distraction or maudlin sentiment. She directs with the humanist, realist sensibility of Renoir, and like the great humanist films, \"Enough Said\" depicts our shared experience, illuminates the individual and celebrates what it means to be human.", "[on _Gigli (2003)_ (qv)] 'Martin Brest' (qv) is one of the really great directors. Most of what I've learnt that is good comes from Martin - but it just didn't work, in its essence.

I was like, \"Wow, I got to look like that? That's going to be a lot of work. I'm not sure I can be in quite that good of a shape. But Henry definitely set a high bar.
