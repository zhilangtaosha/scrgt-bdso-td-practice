Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD, placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts.Walter 'Bruce Willis' (qv) was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene K. (from Kassel), and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \"discovered\" whilst working in a caf\u00e9 in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \"David Addison\" alongside sultry 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv) in the hit romantic comedy television series _Moonlighting (1985)_ (qv). The series firmly established 'Bruce Willis' (qv) as a hot new talent, and his sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. was in effect a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \"John McClane\" in the monster hit _Die Hard (1988)_ (qv). This superbly paced action film balanced laconic humor and wholesale destruction as Willis' character single handedly battles a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Willis reprized the role of tough guy cop \"John McClane\" in the eagerly anticipated sequel _Die Hard 2 (1990)_ (qv) set at snowbound Washington's Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel _Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995)_ (qv) this time also starring 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv) as a cynical Harlem shopowner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in NYC.Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of \"Mikey\" the baby in the very popular family comedies _Look Who's Talking (1989)_ (qv), and its sequel _Look Who's Talking Too (1990)_ (qv) also starring 'John Travolta' (qv) and 'Kirstie Alley' (qv). Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. _The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)_ (qv) and _Hudson Hawk (1991)_ (qv) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyperviolent _The Last Boy Scout (1991)_ (qv), the darkly humored _Death Becomes Her (1992)_ (qv) and the mediocre police thriller _Striking Distance (1993)_ (qv). During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing _North (1994)_ (qv), as a cagey prizefighter in the 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) directed mega-hit _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv), the 'Terry Gilliam' (qv) directed apocalyptic thriller _Twelve Monkeys (1995)_ (qv), the 'Luc Besson' (qv) directed sci-fi opus _The Fifth Element (1997)_ (qv) and the 'M. Night Shyamalan' (qv) directed spine-tingling epic _The Sixth Sense (1999)_ (qv).Willis next starred in the gangster comedy _The Whole Nine Yards (2000)_ (qv), worked again with \"hot\" director 'M. Night Shyamalan' (qv) in the less gripping _Unbreakable (2000)_ (qv), and in two military dramas, _Hart's War (2002)_ (qv) and _Tears of the Sun (2003)_ (qv) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded 'Frank Miller' (qv) graphic novel turned movie _Sin City (2005)_ (qv), the voice of \"RJ\" the scheming raccoon in the animated hit _Over the Hedge (2006)_ (qv) and \"Die Hard\" fans rejoiced to see \"John McClane\" return to the big screen in the high tech _Live Free or Die Hard (2007)_ (qv) aka \"Die Hard 4.0\".Willis was married to actress 'Demi Moore' (qv) for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three daughters.::firehouse44@hotmail.com"], "spouse": ["'Emma Heming Willis' (qv)::(21 March 2009 - present) ( 2 children)", "'Demi Moore' (qv)::(21 November 1987 - 18 October 2000) ( divorced) ( 3 children)"], "trade mark": ["Frequently plays a man who suffered a tragedy, had lost something or had a  crisis of confidence or conscience.", "Frequently plays likeable wisecracking heroes with a moral centre", "Headlines action-adventures, often playing a policeman, hitman or someone in the military", "Often plays men who get caught up in situations far beyond their control", "Sardonic one-liners", "Shaven head", "Distinctive, gravelly voice", "Smirky grin.", "Known for playing cynical anti-heroes with unhappy personal lives"], "trivia": ["Was high school student council president.", "His recording of \"Respect Yourself\" reached #5 in January 1987.", "Bruce and Demi announce they are ending their marriage of 11 years.

Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. But other than that, I want the government to take care of people who need help, like the kids in foster care, the half a million kids who are in orphanages right now - they call them foster homes, but they're orphanages. I want them to take care of the elderly and give them free medicine, give them whatever they need. There's tons, billions and billions of dollars that are just being wasted. Okay? I hate government. I'm apolitical. Write that down: I'm not a Republican.", "[February 2006] Look at what happened to 'James Frey' (qv) in the last two weeks. That's a great book and so is the follow-up book. And just because his publisher chose to say that these were memoirs, it took it out of being a work of fiction, a great work of fiction and very well-written to this guy having to go be sucker punched on _The Oprah Winfrey Show (1986)_ (qv) by one of the most powerful women in television just to grind her own ax about it. Hey Oprah, you had President ['Bill Clinton' (qv)] on your show and if this prick didn't lie about a couple of things I'm going to set myself on fire right now. 'James Frey' (qv) is a writer, okay? He can write whatever he wants. It's fiction, and it's just hard, it's just shameful how he was treated in some of these things. It's just shameful and it's just not fair and not right...", "I'm not an action hero anymore, and I think it would be inappropriate for me to compare anything that happens in Hollywood and the entertainment industry to the tragic loss of life on September 11th.", "I spoke to the Colombians. It's fine. I get passionate sometimes. I said Colombia because it was the first country to come to mind. The drug problem has as much to do with what's going on in this country. If there wasn't a demand, there wouldn't be a supply.", "I think what the United States, and everyone who cares about protecting the freedoms that the largest part of the free world now has, should do whatever it takes to end terrorism in the world and not just in the Middle East. I'm talking also about going to Colombia and doing whatever it takes to end the cocaine trade. It's killing this country. It's killing all the countries that coke goes into. I believe that somebody's making money on it in the United States. If they weren't making money on it, they would have stopped it. They could stop it in one day. It's just a plant that they grow, and these guys are growing it like it's corn or tobacco or any other thing. By the time it gets here, it becomes a billion dollar industry. And I think that's a form of terrorism as well.", "The Iraqi people want to live in a world where they can move from their homes to the market and not have to fear being killed. I mean, doesn't everybody want that?", "I have zero interest in performing in films to try to convey any kind of message. My job is to be entertaining. There's a very different point of view about messages in films in Europe than there is in the States. Audiences rebel because they feel that they are being preached to.", "[on his planned film about the Iraq war] The movie is about these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom.", "I thought about signing up but my friends told me I was too old. I called the White House, called President ['George Bush' (qv)] and asked what I could do. So I got involved with the national foster care program.", "If you take guns away from legal gun owners then the only people who would have guns would be the bad guys. Even a pacifist would get violent if someone were trying to kill him or her. You would fight for your life, whatever your beliefs. You'd use a rock or tear one of these chairs out of the floor. Hey, maybe I've been watching too many 'Bruce Willis' (qv) movies!", "I'm always being accused of being a Hollywood Republican, but I'm not! I have just as many Democratic ideas as Republican ones. If they could build three fewer bombs every month and give the money to foster care, that would be great.", "The idea of serving my country remained in my mind. Over the past few years from varying sources - Time magazine, books, and television - information began coming to my attention on Foster Care; its history and the current crisis of an antiquated system overburdened with 580,000 children who have no voice. Children need to be protected by interstate technology systems that can track placements, education, medical records and protect these children from predators traveling from state to state. I saw Foster Care as a way for me to serve my country in a system by which shining a little bit of light could benefit a great deal by helping kids who were literally wards of the government.", "Hair loss is God's way of telling me I'm human.", "[1998] Organized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms. They were all very important when we didn't know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred or volcanoes happened. Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! I choose not to believe that's the way. And that's what makes America cool, you know?", "I don't think my opinion means jack shit, because I'm an actor. Why do actors think their opinions mean more because you act? You just caught a break as an actor. There are hundreds - thousands - of actors who are just as good as I am, and probably better. Have you heard anything useful come out of an actor's mouth lately? Although I liked 'George Clooney' (qv)'s documentary on Darfur.", "They still haven't caught the guy that killed ['John F. Kennedy' (qv)]. I'll get killed for saying this, but I'm pretty sure those guys are still in power, in some form. The entire government of the United States was co-opted.", "I happen to live in Los Angeles and it is probably one of the most toxic environments on earth. People live here and they know that the air is poisonous. They know that children are affected by the air in Los Angeles. They say that growing up in Los Angeles is the equivalent of smoking a pack and a half of cigarettes throughout your entire childhood. It's horrific when you can actually look at the air and see it.", "No, I am not in favor of the war in Iraq, so let me stop you right there. I am not pro-war but what I am is that, I like to support the young men and women who are over there participating in the war.", "[on Twitter] I just can't live with myself if I started twittering. I just think: \"That way lies madness\".", "[on _The Expendables (2010)_ (qv) sequel] I talked to Sly ['Sylvester Stallone' (qv)] and he's going for all the marbles this time, and he's going to get everybody in this time. Even Stone Cold 'Steve Austin' (qv), who took two bullets in the last film, is coming back. Hopefully, they'll start shooting it while we're young enough to survive!", "[on the possibility of 'Michael Bay' (qv) directing a a Die Hard film, specifically _Live Free or Die Hard (2007)_ (qv)] Would have ruined DH4. Few people will work with him now, and I know I will never work with him again.", "[on whether an R-rated 'Die Hard' could be done without producer 'Joel Silver' (qv)] Fuck 'Joel Silver' (qv). That is because you do not understand my relationship with Joel S. We are cordial now when we bump into each other, but we have not worked together since _The Last Boy Scout (1991)_ (qv).", "I'm really pleased to continue to be asked back to do other versions and other incarnations of _Die Hard (1988)_ (qv). The first one really is... that's all there is. Everything else is just trying to be as good as that film.", "[on _A Good Day to Die Hard (2013)_ (qv)] It's a difficult title. A Good Day to Die Hard? It's like, have a sandwich and let's go shopping - then die hard.", "I want to do _A Good Day to Die Hard (2013)_ (qv), then one final Die Hard movie - Die Hard 6 - before finally hanging that white vest up for good. At the moment, I can run and I can fight on screen. But there will come a time when I no longer want to do that. That's when I'll step away from the Die Hard films.", "[on missing a role in _Full Metal Jacket (1987)_ (qv)] I got the call two days before we were to start the first _Moonlighting (1985)_ (qv). I was crushed! I'd always been a student of the Vietnam war. As it turned out, it took them two years to complete the film and get it out. So, everything happens for a reason.", "I don't cheat, lie or go out of my way to mess people over, but I'm still amazed at the venal garbage that goes on in this town. People lie about you. People want to see you fail. It's so competitive here, you can see how much people want you to fail.", "[on 'Kim Basinger' (qv)] What sets her apart from other actresses is that she does a lot of things well. Kim is a throwback to '40s actresses. She's not afraid to act like a geek.", "[on his NYC bartending days at Cafe Central, during which time he had acquired the nickname 'Bruno'] The bar was always six-deep. It was where a lot of celebs and movie-star types and wannabes hung out. If you're serving them drinks and you're drinking with them, it's a very fraternal feeling. They're not way up on a pedestal. It's four in the morning and they're probably half in the bag. So I didn't have to deal with that mystique.", "For a long time, I don't know if there was a lot of controversy SURROUNDING me, but it was certainly more interesting to throw rocks and dump trash on me than it was to say nice things about me. That kind of controversy sells more. And has since become, in the last ten years since they started writing about me, the norm.", "Look, this is my face. If it's a curse, it's a curse. And I never said, hey, I'm smirking, America! Look at me! Love me! It's a little hook that they caught on and they've found a way to turn it against me and make it some negative thing, but that's how I smile.
