At 16, he left Crieff and Morrison Academy to join the Perth Repertory Theatre. His parents encouraged him to leave school and pursue his acting goals rather than be unhappy. McGregor studied drama for a year at Kirkcaldly in Fife, then enrolled at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama for a three-year course. He studied alongside Daniel Craig and Alistair McGowan among others, and left right before graduating after snagging the role of Private Mick Hopper in Dennis Potter's 1993 six-part Channel 4 series \"Lipstick on Your Collar\" (1993).\n\nHis first notable role was that of Alex Law in Shallow Grave (1994), directed by Danny Boyle, written by John Hodge and produced by Andrew MacDonald. This was followed by The Pillow Book (1996) and Trainspotting (1996), the latter of which brought him to the public's attention.\n\nHe is now one of the most critically acclaimed actors of his generation, and portrays Obi-wan Kenobi in the first three Star Wars episodes. McGregor is married to French production designer Eve Mavrakis, whom he met while working on the TV show \"Kavanagh QC\" (1995). They married in France in the summer of 1995 and have two daughters, Clara Mathilde and Esther Rose. McGregor has formed a production company with friends Jonny Lee Miller, Sean Pertwee, Jude Law and Sadie Frost. Called Natural Nylon, they hope it will make innovative films that do not conform to Hollywood standards.", "popularity": 11.652, "place_of_birth": "Perth, Scotland, UK", "profile_path": "/aEmyadfRXTmmR7UW7OXsm5a6smS.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0000191", "homepage": "http://ewanmcgregor.net/", "images": [{"iso_639_1": null, "width": 540, "height": 720, "vote_count": 3, "vote_average": 5.18, "file_path": "/irncRhIP62qxs1Ifi3jcbkdJvHi.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.75}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 5.19, "file_path": "/6aIyQCQRWRhmxeeeQNdMm6FxfWi.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1312, "height": 1821, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 5.142, "file_path": "/oggdN4O7IDkkVl60VI6iLZfA7Ba.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.72048325096101}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "vote_count": 6, "vote_average": 5.128, "file_path": "/bYDeoQ4aOX2DCklWuRVa4fw8nec.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 5.142, "file_path": "/o9iMtKJlnBnO0YcG6P9crzK4R8C.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1533, "height": 2300, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 5.054, "file_path": "/4L32614GRSYynMfjViUo7uzB2Br.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66652173913043}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1500, "height": 2250, "vote_count": 11, "vote_average": 5.212, "file_path": "/lVjs6E3vriUXhHrAx0mSzyOVts2.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1140, "height": 1710, "vote_count": 9, "vote_average": 5.206, "file_path": "/fHv0hv766frb4nqOua0zX0lqklH.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 5.388, "file_path": "/aEmyadfRXTmmR7UW7OXsm5a6smS.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 692, "height": 1038, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 5.19, "file_path": "/pTyXmuOIcbzkwxstOKBqMoGStFg.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}], "cast": [{"character": "Bob Wilton", "credit_id": "52fe43579251416c7500ca9f", "poster_path": "/dCr1NYTxj7jJi2OlreTzCH7xJcM.jpg", "id": 10313, "video": false, "vote_count": 1321, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/rmg1iMCveruz7mQaY28gPvD0I23.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10752], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Men Who Stare at Goats", "popularity": 10.895, "title": "The Men Who Stare at Goats", "vote_average": 5.9, "overview": "A reporter in Iraq might just have the story of a lifetime when he meets Lyn Cassady, a guy who claims to be a former member of the U.S. Army's New Earth Army, a unit that employs paranormal powers in their missions.", "release_date": "2009-11-05"}, {"character": "The Ghost", "credit_id": "52fe443f9251416c7502e01b", "poster_path": "/p4HtT6IHPAVg8usYdyv8gZN8Qbm.jpg", "id": 11439, "video": false, "vote_count": 1178, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/rgi3ykaqwcC8s4FiQ8QEhdvk662.jpg", "genre_ids": [53, 9648], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Ghost Writer", "popularity": 9.596, "title": "The Ghost Writer", "vote_average": 6.8, "overview": "A writer stumbles upon a long-hidden secret when he agrees to help former British Prime Minister Adam Lang complete his memoirs on a remote island after the politician's assistant drowns in a mysterious accident.
