His work on the series has earned him several awards and more than \u00a360 million.\n\nRadcliffe made his acting debut at age ten in BBC One's television movie David Copperfield (1999), followed by his film debut in 2001's The Tailor of Panama. Cast as Harry at the age of eleven, Radcliffe has starred in seven Harry Potter films since 2001, with the final installment releasing in July 2011. In 2007 Radcliffe began to branch out from the series, starring in the London and New York productions of the play Equus, and the 2011 Broadway revival of the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. The Woman in Black (2012) will be his first film project following the final Harry Potter movie.\n\nRadcliffe has contributed to many charities, including Demelza House Children's Hospice and The Trevor Project. He has also made public service announcements for the latter. In 2011 the actor was awarded the Trevor Project's \"Hero Award\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Daniel Radcliffe, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "popularity": 5.491, "place_of_birth": "Hammersmith, London, England, UK", "profile_path": "/kMSMa5tR43TLMR14ahU1neFVytz.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0705356", "homepage": null, "images": [{"iso_639_1": null, "width": 600, "height": 900, "vote_count": 9, "vote_average": 4.94, "file_path": "/yKqkvz9MiWF6LWuHkbjSU3xKd7I.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "vote_count": 3, "vote_average": 5.18, "file_path": "/xbHYp0zgFxdwMWlNLohA2qHnegG.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "vote_count": 10, "vote_average": 5.27, "file_path": "/2jIrIRYmdYJiV3qKJByE7Qc8gRP.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "vote_count": 6, "vote_average": 5.12, "file_path": "/rjA3a8PtdTP15PXYixNGDqeigEN.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 5.162, "file_path": "/uRyIVnHTSRYSCmTOhUZrza1StcD.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 500, "height": 750, "vote_count": 6, "vote_average": 5.39, "file_path": "/kMSMa5tR43TLMR14ahU1neFVytz.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}], "cast": [{"character": "Harry Potter", "credit_id": "52fe4273c3a36847f801fa73", "poster_path": "/bFXys2nhALwDvpkF3dP3Vvdfn8b.jpg", "id": 767, "video": false, "vote_count": 11041, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/kRyojLYtWPsBKfDhphhhl1FdM5a.jpg", "genre_ids": [12, 14, 10751], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "popularity": 31.239, "title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "vote_average": 7.6, "overview": "As Harry begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, he discovers an old book marked as 'Property of the Half-Blood Prince', and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.", "release_date": "2009-07-08"}, {"character": "Harry Potter", "credit_id": "52fe44e19251416c7504438d", "poster_path": "/maP4MTfPCeVD2FZbKTLUgriOW4R.jpg", "id": 12444, "video": false, "vote_count": 11276, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/8YA36faYlkpfp6aozcGsqq68pZ9.jpg", "genre_ids": [12, 14, 10751], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1", "popularity": 34.719, "title": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1", "vote_average": 7.8, "overview": "Harry, Ron and Hermione walk away from their last year at Hogwarts to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes, putting an end to Voldemort's bid for immortality.
