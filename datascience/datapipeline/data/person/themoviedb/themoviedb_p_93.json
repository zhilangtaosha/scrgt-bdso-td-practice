His ascent to fame picked up when he became a writer for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and later became a frequent guest on The Tonight Show. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, absurdist comedy routines before packed houses on national tours. Since the 1980s, having branched away from stand-up comedy, he has become a successful actor, playwright, pianist, banjo player, and juggler, eventually earning Emmy, Grammy, and American Comedy awards.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Steve Martin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "popularity": 4.75, "place_of_birth": "Waco, Texas, USA", "profile_path": "/rI2EMvkfKKPKa5z0nM2pFVBtUyO.jpg", "adult": false, "imdb_id": "nm0000188", "homepage": "http://www.stevemartin.com", "images": [{"iso_639_1": null, "width": 540, "height": 720, "vote_count": 1, "vote_average": 5.2232142857143, "file_path": "/8Weyf4wJdKqmWLVN7L3jLw4qf5.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.75}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 300, "height": 450, "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "file_path": "/4p4u7wObxD9XVKaCyEtpXekICLd.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 5.388, "file_path": "/rI2EMvkfKKPKa5z0nM2pFVBtUyO.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "vote_count": 1, "vote_average": 5.297619047619, "file_path": "/t9RtQGebI5HaJu5pgwcZMaS7TKr.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}, {"iso_639_1": null, "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "vote_count": 1, "vote_average": 5.312, "file_path": "/yR0BJLn4FCysiIdwdXWLINu74Go.jpg", "aspect_ratio": 0.66666666666667}], "cast": [{"character": "Adam Schaffer", "credit_id": "52fe4454c3a368484e01d0cd", "poster_path": "/foHRwmVZG7m0XMDq15wRuNoKca6.jpg", "id": 22897, "video": false, "vote_count": 731, "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/lt7K8envOZJGRDfZ8GcN4epSzPd.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10749], "original_language": "en", "original_title": "It's Complicated", "popularity": 6.475, "title": "It's Complicated", "vote_average": 6.4, "overview": "Ten years after their divorce, Jane and Jake Adler unite for their son's college graduation and unexpectedly end up sleeping together.
