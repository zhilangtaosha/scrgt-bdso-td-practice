It was massive and it's completely changed the course of what is available to me to do. Ken gave me my break.\" In the beginning, he originally auditioned for the part of Thor. \"I initially auditioned to play Thor. That was what I was being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And it was in my auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. They saw some temperament that they liked.\" The casting director gave Hiddleston six weeks to bulk up, so he went on a strict diet and gained twenty pounds of muscle. In the end, Branagh decided he was more suitable as the antagonist and cast him as Loki.

Just hit me because I'm protected here and it's fine.' He's like, 'Are you sure?' I was like, 'Yeah, it will look great. Just go for it.'\" He provided the voiceover the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead in 2011 and poetry for iF Poems and The Love Book on iTunes in 2012.On television in 2012, Hiddleston appeared in the BBC Two series The Hollow Crown, portraying Prince Hal opposite Jeremy Irons as Henry IV in the adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part I and Part II.

He has donated items for auction and has supported several charities, including: Small Steps Project, Starlight Children's Foundation, Cure EB, Comic Relief, Red Nose Day USA, Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Amnesty International and Chance to Shine.He is a UK ambassador of the humanitarian and developmental assistance fund group UNICEF. He traveled to Guinea in early 2013 to raise awareness about hunger and malnutrition, and to South Sudan in early 2015 and late 2016 to report the results of the ongoing civil war on the lives of vast numbers of children across the country. Hiddleston is a self-described feminist. In February 2018 he was named as one of the donators by Justice and Equality Fund, the UK version of Time's Up movement. He is also an ambassador of the Illuminating BAFTA campaign, an action which aims to provide opportunities to those who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been given a chance in the film, games and television industries.Hiddleston was previously in a relationship with actress Susannah Fielding, who appeared with him in an episode of Wallander in 2008. Their relationship ended in late 2011. In 2016, Hiddleston dated  American Pop singer Taylor Swift for several months.Hiddleston is a supporter of Scottish football club Rangers F.C..", "Media image and acting style": "One of the highest profile actors in contemporary British popular culture, Hiddleston appeared on Debrett's 2017 list of the most influential people in the UK. In 2015 he was named British Film Institute's first official founding ambassador. Hiddleston won the light-hearted UK award Rear of the Year 2016, in which the public nominate the male and female UK-based celebrities that they think should win the titular award. He has been named most stylish/best dressed man in several lists. Taffy Brodesser-Akner of GQ described his off-screen persona as \"a sweet-natured bookworm given the face and body of the only man who should ever be allowed to wear a suit\". Crimson Peak's director Guillermo del Toro and comic book writer Stan Lee have called him \"the nicest guy on earth/you\u2019ll ever meet\" with del Toro adding that he ruined the usual barrier of being either nice, or good-looking.Kenneth Branagh noted that the first time he ever saw Hiddleston, playing Cassio in Othello, it was quite clear to him that he was an utterly naturalistic speaker of Shakespeare. Michael Billington of The Guardian, wrote that Hiddleston\u2019s key acting quality is his ability to combine a sweet sadness with an incandescent fury, suggesting a fierce intellect gnawed by intense melancholy and yet subjecting to bouts of intemperate rage. Hiddleston spent nearly five weeks preparing for the role of Hank Williams, performing seven of the movie's soundtrack songs. He has claimed that Method acting isn't easy for him, because it doesn't help him as a collaborator. The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish suggests that Hiddleston has got the theatrical acting chops to head up there among the greats, and The Independent's Paul Taylor that his range is beginning to look pretty limitless. David Fear of the Rolling Stone opines that there are two Tom Hiddlestons, the old-school movie star of Midnight in Paris, War Horse or The Night Manager, and the unpredictable, borderline weirdo version of him we can see in characters like Loki or in High-Rise, adding that Hiddleston refuses to settle on one specific kind of role.", "Filmography": "=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\n\n=== Video games ===\n\n\n=== Radio ===", "Awards and nominations": "", "References": "", "External links": "Tom Hiddleston on IMDb \nTom Hiddleston on Twitter \nTom Hiddleston on Facebook\nTom Hiddleston on Instagram"}
